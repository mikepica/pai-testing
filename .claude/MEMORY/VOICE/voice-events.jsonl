It starts with understanding the Algorithm (the engine), moves through TELOS (your goals) and TalentProfile (a real skill), then Memory (the feedback loop), and finishes with you improving the system itself. Each session builds on the last and produces a real artifact. The plan is designed so that by Session 5, you'll have used every major PAI subsystem and have tangible proof of the learning loop working.
