  I've done some interactions with the system and I've changed things. Now I want to do a synthesis of the Memory. I am doing this so I can learn the setup and get hands on experience. what are the commands to test and what should i do. You can evaluate the current memory files to find 1-3 tasks that I can could do that help me learn for the specific data that we currently have. ask me questions if needed.
