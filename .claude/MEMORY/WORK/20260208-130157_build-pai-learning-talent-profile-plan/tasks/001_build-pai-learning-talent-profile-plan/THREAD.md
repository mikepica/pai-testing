prompt: |
  I want to learn how memory works in this system. Help me build a plan where I can start editing my Talent Profile and use the Memory from the conversations and apply the learnings to improve the system. The goal i have is to learn the PAI framework with an in depth understanding.
  
  Here are two sources on the PAI framework: https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure AND https://danielmiessler.com/blog/the-last-algorithm.
  
  The in depth understanding will be of practical use to ad
