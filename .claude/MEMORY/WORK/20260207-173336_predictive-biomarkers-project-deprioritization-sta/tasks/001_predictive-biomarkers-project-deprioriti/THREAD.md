  The Predictive Biomarkers project, I haven't been able to come up with an idea. I'm transitioning my mission so that I focus exclusively on projects that work well with the exponential increase of AI. I deprioritize any projects that don't will have work that is not needed 3 months down the road.

# Algorithm Thread: Predictive Biomarkers project deprioritization statement

## Phase Log

### 👀 OBSERVE Phase
- User couldn't generate viable idea for Predictive Biomarkers
- Announcing mission transition: focus on AI-exponential-aligned projects only
- New filter: deprioritize work that won't be needed in 3 months

### 🧠 THINK Phase
- Applied FirstPrinciples to articulate the "3-Month AI Displacement Test"
- PASS = AI growth makes work MORE valuable; FAIL = AI growth makes work OBSOLETE
- Predictive Biomarkers fails: bespoke ML prediction will be displaced by foundational models

### 📋 PLAN Phase
- Capture decision and strategic framework in MEMORY/LEARNING/STRATEGY
- Update work session to reflect completed deprioritization

### 🔨 BUILD + ▶️ EXECUTE Phase
- Created: `MEMORY/LEARNING/STRATEGY/2026-02/2026-02-07_LEARNING_predictive-biomarkers-deprioritized-mission-pivot.md`
- Documented: decision, rationale, 3-month test framework, mission transition implications

### ✅ VERIFY Phase
- All files written and verified

### 🎓 LEARN Phase
- Apply 3-month AI displacement test BEFORE investing evaluation effort on new ideas
- "No viable idea" is itself a signal — don't force-fit projects that don't align

## ISC Evolution

- ISC 1: Predictive Biomarkers marked deprioritized ✅
- ISC 2: Mission filter articulated ✅
- ISC 3: Strategic learning captured ✅
- ISC 4: Decision rationale specific and actionable ✅

## Key Observations

- The inability to generate a viable idea was a feature, not a bug — it correctly signaled misalignment with the user's evolving strategic direction
- The 3-month AI displacement test is a powerful general-purpose filter for project selection
