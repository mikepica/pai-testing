# Failure Analysis: assistant ignored ai trajectory analysis requirement in planning

**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Rating:** 3/10
**Summary:** Dissatisfied, system missing critical AI trajectory analysis

---

## What Happened

User was attempting to use PAI to evaluate career decisions with consideration for exponential AI advancement. User explicitly requested that the system automatically factor in rapid AI technological growth when analyzing career paths—a reasonable expectation for forward-looking career planning in 2024-2025. PAI failed to integrate this crucial variable into the analysis framework. The frustration stems from PAI treating career evaluation as a static problem rather than accounting for how AI acceleration will reshape skill relevance, job markets, and opportunity windows. User's self-assigned rating of 3 indicates mild but clear dissatisfaction. The root issue: PAI should have proactively included AI trajectory analysis as a foundational component when analyzing SKILLS and INTERESTS in a career context. What PAI did right: completed the ISC criteria framework. What PAI missed: recognizing that career planning in the AI era requires dynamic reassessment of skill durability and market positioning relative to AI capability growth curves. This reveals User values forward-thinking analysis and expects PAI to anticipate how acceleration changes decision-making logic.
