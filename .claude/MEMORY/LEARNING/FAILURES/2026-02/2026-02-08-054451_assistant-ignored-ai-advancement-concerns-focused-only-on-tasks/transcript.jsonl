Their career path in enterprise healthcare would move from individual contributor to senior IC or innovation lead, then into management of AI innovation, eventually reaching director or VP level roles in AI strategy.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":817,"cache_read_input_tokens":40389,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":817},"output_tokens":10,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXvg3NYTFBwYkC8zsusnX","type":"assistant","uuid":"ff8a037f-1702-4c0c-9b9c-86225011ab2f","timestamp":"2026-02-08T13:23:25.758Z"}

It's:\n1. **Problem selection** — knowing WHAT to build (domain expertise + strategic judgment)\n2. **Organizational orchestration** — getting enterprises to actually adopt and change\n\n\n3. **Systems thinking** — understanding how AI fits into complex business ecosystems\n4. **Judgment under uncertainty** — deciding between 100 possible AI applications, which 3 will actually create value\n5. **Trust and influence** — the human network that decides where resources go\n\nSo the real career move isn't becoming better at building AI—it's becoming the person who knows which AI problems matter, how to navigate organizational adoption, and can command the resources and trust to make it happen. That trajectory points toward Chief AI Officer or Chief Innovation Officer roles where the leverage comes from strategic vision and organizational influence, not technical execution.\n\nThe capabilities that actually matter at that level are strategic judgment about which problems are worth solving, organizational design to restructure around AI capabilities, ethics and governance as these systems become more powerful, and the ability to recognize patterns across industries—seeing what worked in finance and applying it to pharma. It's also about vendor strategy at scale and the executive presence to shape board-level decisions about how the company transforms.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":470,"cache_read_input_tokens":45908,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":470},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXvghEwN3PUz6nTJTRqdk","type":"assistant","uuid":"0c871419-3755-443c-8538-2146f081fd27","timestamp":"2026-02-08T13:32:01.509Z"}

Let me rethink the entire plan around this insight.\n\n━━━ 🔄 REVISED BUILD ━━━\n\n### The Deeper Question: When AI Building Is Commoditized, What's Scarce?\n\nYou're right that frameworks and prototyping will get easier. They already are. So let's decompose what remains valuable using FirstPrinciples:\n\n**What AI commoditizes:** Building, coding, prototyping, basic implementation\n**What AI CANNOT commoditize:**\n\n| Scarce Skill | Why It Stays Scarce | Enterprise Value |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Problem selection judgment** | Knowing which of 200 possible AI projects will actually create value requires deep domain expertise + strategic sense. AI can build anything — knowing WHAT to build is the moat. | This is how budgets get allocated |\n| **Organizational transformation** | Getting 10,000 people to actually change how they work is a human orchestration problem, not a technology problem | This is how AI projects survive past the demo |\n| **Governance & risk judgment** | Healthcare + AI = high stakes. Someone has to decide what's safe, ethical, and compliant. That requires domain depth + values + political skill | This is how enterprises avoid catastrophic AI failures |\n| **Cross-domain pattern recognition** | Seeing that what worked for claims processing also applies to clinical trial recruitment — that requires breadth | This is how you 10x the innovation pipeline |\n| **Trust-based influence** | The C-suite funds people they trust, not technology they understand | This is how ideas become investments |\n\n### Revised Career Ladder — Thinking Beyond VP\n\n```\nNOW                12-18 MO              3-5 YR                 5-8 YR                  8-12 YR\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIC                 AI Innovation Lead    Sr. AI Strategy Lead    VP / Head of AI         Chief AI Officer\n(Product/Strategy)                                               Innovation              or Chief Innovation\n                                                                                         Officer\n\nYour moat:         Your moat:            Your moat:              Your moat:              Your moat:\nDomain knowledge   \"I know WHAT to       \"I've built a           \"I redesign how the     \"I set the AI\n+ AI curiosity     build and can          repeatable system       enterprise operates     strategy for the\n                   prove it works\"        for finding +           with AI — not just      entire company\n                                          validating AI           what tools we use,      and sit at the\n                                          opportunities\"          but how we WORK\"        table with the\n                                                                                          board\"\n\nCommoditized at    Commoditized at       Commoditized at         Commoditized at         NOT commoditized:\nthis level:        this level:           this level:             this level:             Strategic judgment\nNothing yet        Prototyping           POC building            Even strategy           + org transformation\n                   (others can too)      (AI tools do this)      consulting gets AI      + trust = human\n                                                                  augmented               capital forever\n```\n\n### The Skills That Matter in a Post-Commoditization World\n\nI'm restructuring the skill tiers around **what stays scarce**:\n\n#### Tier 1 — Build NOW (these compound over time)\n| Skill | Why It's Durable | How to Start |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Healthcare AI governance & ethics** | Regulatory judgment can't be automated. FDA, HIPAA, clinical safety — you need to be the person in the room who knows what's allowed | Study NIST AI RMF + FDA AI/ML action plan. Become your org's go-to on \"can we do this?\" |\n| **Business case architecture** | Not just ROI spreadsheets — framing AI opportunities as strategic bets with risk/reward | Build a reusable framework: problem → data feasibility → effort → value → risk |\n| **Executive communication & influence** | The skill that converts prototypes into funded programs. Human trust doesn't commoditize. | Practice: 3-minute pitch for every POC. Get feedback from directors/VPs. |\n| **Agentic AI + LLM fluency** | You still need enough technical depth to evaluate what's possible and guide teams | Build 3-5 prototypes. Not to prove you can code — to build intuition for what's feasible. |\n\n#### Tier 2 — Build in 3-9 months (strategic differentiation)\n| Skill | Why It's Durable | How to Start |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Organizational change management** | When everyone can prototype, the bottleneck is adoption. You need to move the humans. | Prosci certification or equivalent. Apply it to your first AI rollout. |\n| **Cross-domain pattern recognition** | Read broadly: what's working in fintech, retail, defense AI? Translate patterns to pharma. | Set up a weekly AI industry scan. Build a \"patterns library\" of cross-industry insights. |\n| **Data strategy & data governance** | Models commoditize. DATA doesn't. The person who understands the enterprise data landscape wins. | Map your org's data assets. Know where the gold is and what's locked behind governance. |\n| **Vendor strategy & build/buy/partner** | Enterprises will buy more AI than they build. Knowing when to buy vs. build = massive leverage. | Evaluate 3 vendors per quarter. Build a scoring framework. |\n\n#### Tier 3 — Build in 9-18 months (executive trajectory)\n| Skill | Why It's Durable |\n|---|---|\n| **Board-level AI communication** | Translate AI implications into business risk and opportunity for non-technical leaders |\n| **AI portfolio management** | Managing a portfolio of AI bets like a VC — fund/kill/pivot based on evidence |\n| **Enterprise architecture thinking** | Not just individual AI solutions — how AI reshapes the entire operating model |\n| **Industry thought leadership** | Publishing, speaking, building external reputation. This compounds and creates gravity. |\n\n### The Key Insight for Your Profile\n\nYour internal positioning shouldn't be **\"I build AI prototypes.\"** It should be:\n\n> **\"I identify the highest-value AI opportunities in our enterprise, prove they work, and orchestrate the organization to adopt them.\"**\n\nThat's not a statement about technology. It's a statement about judgment, influence, and transformation. It stays true whether prototyping takes 2 weeks or 2 hours."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":470,"cache_read_input_tokens":45908,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":470},"output_tokens":8,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXvghEwN3PUz6nTJTRqdk","type":"assistant","uuid":"19949871-3828-441d-b01d-4358e3730373","timestamp":"2026-02-08T13:32:37.324Z"}

Apply this gate BEFORE constraint mapping (S1) to avoid sunk evaluation cost on strategically misaligned projects.\n\n## S6: Proof Before Permission\nDon't ask for a budget to explore AI. Build a prototype against a visible pain point, demo it to the person who owns that pain, and let the demo create the demand. A working 5-minute demo beats a 30-slide strategy deck. Find one VP sponsor who gets it — one champion is worth more than org-wide awareness.\n\n## S7: Speak Outcomes, Not Technology\nHealthcare execs care about: time-to-decision, error reduction, compliance risk, FTE hours saved. They don't care about: LLMs, RAG, agentic, embeddings. Every pitch, every demo, every email — translate technology into the outcomes they're measured on.\n\n## S8: Build for the Post-Commoditization World\nWhen AI prototyping is commoditized (and it will be), three things stay scarce: (1) judgment about WHAT to build, (2) ability to orchestrate organizational change, (3) governance and risk judgment in regulated domains. Invest disproportionately in these skills. Technical depth serves as credibility fuel, not as the core value proposition.\n\n## S9: Compound Credibility Through a Wins Log\nDocument every prototype, demo, stakeholder reaction, and outcome in a running log. Each small win compounds into a portfolio that justifies bigger bets. The wins log becomes your budget justification, your promotion case, and your proof of capability — all in one artifact.\n\n## S10: Create FOMO as a Strategic Tool\nTrack what competitors and peer enterprises are doing with AI. \"Pfizer just deployed X\" or \"UnitedHealth reduced Y by 40% with AI\" is a powerful motivator for enterprise leadership who otherwise delay decisions."}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":775,"cache_read_input_tokens":56871,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":775},"output_tokens":24,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CXvhNQLWD8wU75uSyQM3Q","type":"assistant","uuid":"faa747a0-486e-4864-83bc-ae1b79ea3500","timestamp":"2026-02-08T13:40:55.618Z"}
