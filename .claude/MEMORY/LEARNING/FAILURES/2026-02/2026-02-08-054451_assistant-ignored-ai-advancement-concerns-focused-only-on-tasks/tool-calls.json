Projects that compete with AI's trajectory (bespoke solutions AI will do better) fail. Apply this gate BEFORE constraint mapping (S1) to avoid sunk evaluation cost on strategically misaligned projects.\n\n## S6: Proof Before Permission\nDon't ask for a budget to explore AI. Build a prototype against a visible pain point, demo it to the person who owns that pain, and let the demo create the demand. A working 5-minute demo beats a 30-slide strategy deck. Find one VP sponsor who gets it — one champion is worth more than org-wide awareness.\n\n## S7: Speak Outcomes, Not Technology\nHealthcare execs care about: time-to-decision, error reduction, compliance risk, FTE hours saved. They don't care about: LLMs, RAG, agentic, embeddings. Every pitch, every demo, every email — translate technology into the outcomes they're measured on.\n\n## S8: Build for the Post-Commoditization World\nWhen AI prototyping is commoditized (and it will be), three things stay scarce: (1) judgment about WHAT to build, (2) ability to orchestrate organizational change, (3) governance and risk judgment in regulated domains. Invest disproportionately in these skills. Technical depth serves as credibility fuel, not as the core value proposition.\n\n## S9: Compound Credibility Through a Wins Log\nDocument every prototype, demo, stakeholder reaction, and outcome in a running log. Each small win compounds into a portfolio that justifies bigger bets. The wins log becomes your budget justification, your promotion case, and your proof of capability — all in one artifact.\n\n## S10: Create FOMO as a Strategic Tool\nTrack what competitors and peer enterprises are doing with AI. \"Pfizer just deployed X\" or \"UnitedHealth reduced Y by 40% with AI\" is a powerful motivator for enterprise leadership who otherwise delay decisions."
