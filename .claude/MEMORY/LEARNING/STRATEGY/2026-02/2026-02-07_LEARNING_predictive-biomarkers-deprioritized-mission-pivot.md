# Strategic Decision: Predictive Biomarkers Deprioritized

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Decision:** DEPRIORITIZE Predictive Biomarkers project
**Status:** Shelved indefinitely

## Context

The Predictive Biomarkers project (ML-based clinical trial success prediction) was evaluated but no viable idea materialized. Rather than force-fit an idea, the user recognized a deeper strategic issue: the project doesn't align with a new operating philosophy.

## The 3-Month AI Displacement Test

**New Mission Filter:** Focus exclusively on projects that benefit from the exponential increase in AI capabilities. Deprioritize any project where the work being done will not be needed 3 months from now.

### The Test (binary):
- **PASS:** "Will AI's growth in 3 months make this work MORE valuable?" → Pursue
- **FAIL:** "Will AI's growth in 3 months make this work OBSOLETE?" → Deprioritize

### Why Predictive Biomarkers Fails:
1. **No viable idea generated** — couldn't find a unique angle
2. **AI displacement risk** — ML prediction of clinical trial outcomes is a capability that foundational models and specialized biomedical AI will handle better within months
3. **Work becomes obsolete** — building bespoke prediction infrastructure now means competing with rapidly improving general-purpose AI tools

## Mission Transition

The user is pivoting from "projects I can do" to "projects that RIDE the AI exponential curve." This means:
- Projects that CREATE leverage using AI (amplifiers, not competitors)
- Projects where AI makes the human contribution MORE valuable, not less
- Projects where the 3-month horizon shows the work becoming more relevant, not automated away

## Implications for Future Project Selection

When evaluating new ideas, apply the 3-month AI displacement test FIRST, before investing evaluation effort. This prevents the sunk-cost pattern of evaluating projects that will fail the strategic filter anyway.
