## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

User received a system notification that a research task ("Research ML clinical trial prediction") had completed and generated a comprehensive report. The message is purely informational—it contains the full text of a detailed clinical trial prediction research report spanning five sections: existing published models, data availability, known limitations, pharma-specific context, and regulatory considerations. No emotional language, no directives, no requests for modification or correction. This is a passive receipt of completed work output, not an evaluation of PAI's performance. The absence of any sentiment marker (satisfaction, frustration, appreciation, disappointment) combined with the purely transactional nature of the notification means no meaningful sentiment toward PAI can be inferred. This is equivalent to receiving a file in a folder—it conveys information but not emotion about the delivery.

## Assistant Response Context

✅ **VERIFY:**
- **Data Scientist** gets 3 questions covering: data accessibility/joinability, pre-trial feature availability, labeled outcome sufficiency
- **R&D Scientist** gets 3 questions covering: biological predictability of failure modes, actionability of predictions at portfolio review, temporal drift in trial design
- All 4 BLOCKED gaps from evaluation are covered (data access → DS Q1, labeled outcomes → DS Q3, pre-trial features → DS Q2, actionability → RD Q2)
- Each question has Contex
