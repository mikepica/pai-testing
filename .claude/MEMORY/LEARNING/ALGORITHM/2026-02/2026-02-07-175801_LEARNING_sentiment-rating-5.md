## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

User received a system notification that a research task ('Agent Research pharma ML trial prediction') has completed. The notification includes a comprehensive deliverable: a multi-perspective feasibility and ROI analysis of ML-based clinical trial success prediction for AstraZeneca. The message contains 15,000+ words of synthesis covering five analytical angles: cost of clinical trial failure, value proposition of predictive ML, implementation challenges at large pharma, AZ's AI posture, and comparable projects at competitors. The notification is purely informational—it reports completion of work User requested earlier and provides access to the full output. There is no emotional sentiment directed at PAI here. User is receiving factual information about task status and deliverable availability. This is a transactional system message, not a reaction to PAI's performance or behavior.

But the evaluation surfaced 4 unvalidated assumptions that all come down to one question: **can you actually get the data you need?** Temporal drift, labeled outcome availability, pre-trial feature
