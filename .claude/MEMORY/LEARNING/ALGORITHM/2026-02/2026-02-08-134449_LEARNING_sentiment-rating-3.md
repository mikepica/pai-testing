## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

User was working with PAI to develop a career evolution plan across multiple profile files (SKILLS.md, INTERESTS.md, etc.). PAI completed the task and marked it as verified (6/7 criteria met), but User identified a critical gap: PAI failed to factor exponential AI technology advancement into the career guidance. User expects PAI to automatically contextualize career decisions within rapid AI development trajectories—considering skill durability, obsolescence risk, and future-proofing. This reflects a sophisticated expectation that PAI should proactively integrate forward-looking analysis (especially regarding AI's disruptive potential) rather than treating career planning as static. The frustration isn't with execution quality but with strategic blindness—PAI completed the task competently but missed the meta-layer User values: anticipatory risk assessment. User's rating (3) indicates mild but meaningful disappointment, not anger. PAI should have flagged considerations like: which skills remain durable amid AI automation, which are vulnerable to 2-5 year disruption, and how to structure learning for optionality. This reveals User prioritizes foresight and proactive risk awareness over task completion alone.
