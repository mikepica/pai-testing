## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

User received a system task notification indicating successful completion of the 'Create rd-scientist TELOS files' agent task.

This is purely informational—User is not expressing satisfaction or dissatisfaction with PAI's work, asking for help, or evaluating performance. It's a status update that requires no sentiment analysis.
