## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

User received a system notification that their requested task—creating 6 TELOS profile files for the Innovation Lead role—was completed successfully. The message is purely informational: it reports task completion, lists all 6 files created with their purposes, provides a structured summary of each file's contents, includes token usage metrics, and offers a transcript link. There is no emotional language directed at PAI, no praise or criticism of the work quality, and no indication of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. This is a standard operational confirmation with no sentiment indicators present.
