━━━ 🧠 THINK ━━━ 2/7

🔍 **THINKING TOOLS ASSESSMENT** (justify exclusion):
│ Council:          EXCLUDE — User asked for reflection, not a decision with tradeoffs
│ RedTeam:          EXCLUDE — No claims or proposals to stress-test
│ FirstPrinciples:  INCLUDE — The "why" behind each challenge requires decomposition into root causes
│ Science:          EXCLUDE — Not iterative/experimental
│ BeCreative:       EXCLUDE — Clear requirements, need accuracy not divergence
│ Prompting:        EXCLUDE — No prompt generation needed

🔍 **SKILL CHECK** (validate hook hints against ISC):
│ Hook suggested:   Algorithm
│ ISC requires:     Telos data retrieval (done), FirstPrinciples decomposition of challenge roots
│ Final skills:     No additional skills needed — data already loaded, analysis is the work

🎯 **CAPABILITY SELECTION:**
│ Skills:     None additional needed
│ Thinking:   FirstPrinciples
│ Primary:    Main agent — challenge analysis from loaded Telos data
│ Support:    None needed — data is complete
│ Verify:     Manual check against Telos source
│ Pattern:    Specialist
│ Sequence:   Analyze → Synthesize → Present
│ Rationale:  All five challenges + their root causes are in Telos; the work is decomposition and connection-mapping

**FirstPrinciples Decomposition — Why are these challenges?**

Each challenge traces back to a structural property of User's role: sitting at the intersection of three domains (R&D biology, data science/ML, organizational governance) where information doesn't flow naturally.

━━━ 📋 PLAN ━━━ 3/7

1. Present each of the 5 challenges with the *root reason* it's a challenge (drawing from beliefs, lessons, mental models)
2. Map how the challenges form a reinforcing system
3. Use User's own Telos vocabulary throughout

━━━ 🔨 BUILD + ⚡ EXECUTE ━━━ 4-5/7

## Your 5 Biggest Challenges Right Now

### 1. R&D-ML Feasibility Translation Gap
**The challenge:** R&D scientists describe biology beautifully but can't articulate what an ML model would actually need from their domain.

**Why it's a challenge:** This is the core expression of your Translation Gap mental model — most pharma AI failures stem from translation gaps, not bad science or bad models. The vocabulary mismatch is real: what a scientist calls "biological variability" a data scientist calls "noise." What a scientist calls an "assay measurement" a data scientist calls a "feature." (Lesson L2.) Until someone bridges that, both sides think they're communicating when they're not.

---

### 2. Theory vs. Reality Problem
**The challenge:** Data scientists propose elegant technical solutions that don't solve real pain points. Projects die in the gap between "interesting model" and "useful tool."

**Why it's a challenge:** Your core belief is that the best AI projects solve a *workflow pain point*, not a technology gap. And your sharpest evaluation criterion (Lesson L3) is: *"Would you stop doing the current thing?"* If a prediction doesn't change behavior, accuracy is irrelevant. This challenge persists because data scientists optimize for model performance metrics, while the actual value test is behavioral change in the lab or clinic.

---

### 3. Late-Stage Constraint Discovery
**The challenge:** Cross-functional constraints — regulatory, IT infrastructure, data governance — are invisible until they block a project at month 4. By then, 4 months of effort are wasted.

**Why it's a challenge:** This is your Constraint Iceberg model in action: 80% of project killers are invisible until it's too late. You learned this the hard way (Lesson L1) — a compound screening model failed at month 5 due to a hidden data governance policy. That's why your Strategy S1 is Constraint-First Evaluation, and Idea I3 (Reverse Evaluation) flips the entire approach: start from constraints, see what survives.

---

### 4. Translation Overhead
**The challenge:** 60% of your time is spent translating between domains. If structurable, this would free up time for actual strategy.

**Why it's a challenge:** Your role's value is *seeing across domains and spotting where AI solves real workflow pain points*. But the translation work consumes the strategic bandwidth that makes the role valuable in the first place. It's a paradox: you're most needed for strategy, but most consumed by translation. Strategy S2 (structured written questions before meetings) and S4 (make the invisible visible through artifacts) are your attempts to make this scalable.

---

### 5. Evaluation Bottleneck
**The challenge:** AIXplore generates more ideas than you can evaluate. You need to evaluate faster without losing rigor.

**Why it's a challenge:** Your Q2 goal is to reduce idea-to-pilot from 6 months to 8 weeks while selecting 3-5 high-impact projects. But your Portfolio Thinking mental model says you need diverse bets with uncorrelated failure modes — which means evaluating *more* ideas, not fewer. Strategy S3 (small pilots, fast kills) helps on the back end, but the front-end evaluation throughput is still the bottleneck. Idea I2 (Async Evaluation Sprints) is your answer, but it's still in development.

## How These Challenges Reinforce Each Other

These aren't five independent problems. They form a system:

```
Translation Gap (1) ──► Translation Overhead (4)
         │                        │
         ▼                        ▼
Theory vs Reality (2)    Less time for strategy
         │                        │
         ▼                        ▼
Late Constraint Discovery (3) ◄───┘
         │
         ▼
  Evaluation Bottleneck (5)
```

- **Challenge 1 feeds Challenge 4** — the translation gap *creates* the overhead
- **Challenge 4 feeds Challenge 3** — when you're consumed by translation, you don't have time to surface constraints early
- **Challenge 3 feeds Challenge 5** — late discoveries force re-evaluation, clogging the pipeline further
- **Challenge 2 sits in the middle** — elegant-but-useless proposals waste evaluation cycles *and* require more translation to redirect

The leverage point is **making translation structural rather than personal** (S2, S4, I1). If constraints and cross-domain translations live in artifacts instead of in your head, Challenges 1, 3, 4, and 5 all improve simultaneously.
