# Implicit Low Rating Detected: 3/10

**Date:** 2026-02-07
**Rating:** 3/10
**Detection Method:** Sentiment Analysis
**Sentiment Summary:** Frustrated by repeated freezing issues during work

## Detailed Analysis (for Learning System)

User was executing a plan file (polymorphic-finding-wave.md) when PAI froze mid-execution. This is a recurring problem—User explicitly notes 'not sure why claude keeps freezing'—indicating a pattern of instability. User had to interrupt and restart, then request completion of interrupted work. The frustration stems from: (1) loss of continuity/progress, (2) repeated occurrence suggesting unresolved technical issue, (3) User having to manually intervene and re-prompt rather than work flowing seamlessly. The tone is resigned frustration rather than angry—User is asking for help finishing work rather than demanding fixes. Root cause appears to be either the specific plan file structure, plan execution system stability, or token/context limits. PAI should diagnose why this particular plan freezes repeatedly and either fix it or warn User upfront about known limitations.
