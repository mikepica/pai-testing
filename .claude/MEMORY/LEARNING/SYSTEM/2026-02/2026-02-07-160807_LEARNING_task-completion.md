━━━ 🧠 THINK ━━━ 2/7

🔍 **THINKING TOOLS ASSESSMENT** (justify exclusion):
│ Council:          EXCLUDE — Single retrieval + synthesis, no decision to debate
│ RedTeam:          EXCLUDE — No claims to stress-test
│ FirstPrinciples:  INCLUDE — Decomposing what makes this mission *this person's* mission, not a generic statement
│ Science:          EXCLUDE — Not iterative/experimental
│ BeCreative:       EXCLUDE — Accuracy over divergence
│ Prompting:        EXCLUDE — No prompt generation needed

🔍 **SKILL CHECK:**
│ Hook suggested:   Algorithm
│ ISC requires:     Telos data (already loaded), FirstPrinciples to decompose mission roots
│ Final skills:     None additional — data is complete from prior turn

🎯 **CAPABILITY SELECTION:**
│ Skills:     None additional
│ Thinking:   FirstPrinciples (light — decompose mission into its grounding elements)
│ Primary:    Main agent — synthesis from loaded Telos
│ Pattern:    Specialist
│ Sequence:   Retrieve → Decompose → Present
│ Rationale:  Mission + supporting context already in memory; work is connecting the pieces

━━━ 📋 PLAN ━━━ 3/7

1. Present the mission statement as recorded
2. Decompose *why* this is your mission — what beliefs, lessons, and models make it yours specifically
3. Show how it connects to the challenges we just discussed

━━━ 🔨 BUILD + ⚡ EXECUTE ━━━ 4-5/7

## Your Mission

> **Identify and champion AI-driven R&D projects that accelerate drug discovery at AstraZeneca.**
>
> **Bridge the gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable.**
>
> **Your value is in seeing across domains, spotting where AI solves real workflow pain points, and building cross-functional buy-in.**

## Why This Is *Your* Mission (FirstPrinciples Decomposition)

This mission has three layers, and each one is grounded in something you've learned:

**Layer 1 — "Identify and champion"**
You're not the one building the models or running the assays. Your role is *selection and advocacy*. This is why the Evaluation Bottleneck (Challenge 5) hits you so directly — if you can't evaluate fast enough, you can't champion the right things.

**Layer 2 — "Bridge what's scientifically possible and organizationally achievable"**
This comes from your Translation Gap mental model and Lesson L1 (the compound screening model that died at month 5 from a hidden governance policy). Science and org reality are two separate worlds. Most people live in one. Your job is to hold both simultaneously.

**Layer 3 — "Seeing across domains, spotting where AI solves real workflow pain points"**
This is your sharpest belief in action: *the best AI projects solve a workflow pain point, not a technology gap.* Combined with Lesson L3 — *"Would you stop doing the current thing?"* — this gives you a filter most AI innovation leads don't have. You're not looking for impressive models. You're looking for behavior change.

## How Your Mission Connects to Your Challenges

Your five challenges aren't obstacles *to* your mission — they're the *cost* of your mission:

| Mission Element | Challenge It Creates |
|----------------|---------------------|
| Seeing across domains | Translation Gap (1) + Translation Overhead (4) |
| Bridging science and org reality | Late Constraint Discovery (3) |
| Spotting real pain points | Theory vs. Reality (2) |
| Selecting and championing | Evaluation Bottleneck (5) |

The challenges exist *because* the mission is the right one. If the mission were easier, it wouldn't be as valuable.
