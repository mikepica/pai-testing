### SCORECARD SUMMARY

| Criterion | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Scientific Merit | 3/5 | DONE |
| Implementation Feasibility | 3/5 | DONE |
| ROI Potential | 4/5 | DONE |
| Risk (inverted) | 3/5 | DONE |
| 8-Week Pilot | Likely | DONE |
| Assumptions Classified | 28 surfaced, 4 broken | DONE |
| Gaps for Team Input | 6 identified | DONE |

**Overall: NEEDS INPUT** — The idea has genuine value potential (ROI 4/5), but 4 broken assumptions in the naive framing and 6 unresolved gaps mean it should not proceed as-stated. The **reconstructed version** (3 focused intelligence tools starting with a base rate dashboard) is significantly stronger.
