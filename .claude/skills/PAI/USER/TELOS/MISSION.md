# Mission

I identify and champion AI-driven R&D projects that accelerate drug discovery at AstraZeneca. I bridge the gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable.

My value is not in doing the science or building the models — it's in seeing across domains, spotting where AI can solve real workflow pain points, and building the cross-functional buy-in that gets projects from idea to pilot.
