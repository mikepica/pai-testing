# Models

## The Translation Gap Model
Most AI projects in pharma fail not because the science is wrong or the model is bad, but because there's a translation gap between the domain expert's mental model and the ML engineer's solution space. My job is to close that gap before anyone writes a line of code.

## The Constraint Iceberg
Visible constraints (budget, timeline, headcount) are 20% of what kills a project. The other 80% — data governance, regulatory interpretation, trust deficits, protocol incompatibilities — are invisible until month 4. Surface them early or waste months.

## Portfolio Thinking vs. Project Thinking
Individual project success is less important than portfolio composition. A portfolio of 5 medium-confidence bets with diverse failure modes beats 2 high-confidence bets with correlated risk.
