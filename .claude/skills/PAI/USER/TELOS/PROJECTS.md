# Projects

| Project | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Clinical Trial Success Predictor | Evaluating | AIXplore proposal — needs team constraint input |
| Lab Notebook NLP | Backlog | Promising but data access is unclear |
| Compound Screening ML | In Pilot | 3 months in, showing early results on small molecules |
| Predictive Biomarkers | **Deprioritized** | Fails 3-month AI displacement test; no viable idea generated; bespoke ML prediction will be displaced by foundational models |
