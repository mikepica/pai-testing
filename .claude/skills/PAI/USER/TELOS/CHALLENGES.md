# Challenges

- R&D scientists can describe biology beautifully but can't articulate AI feasibility — I need to help them surface what an ML model would actually need from their domain
- Data scientists propose elegant technical solutions that don't solve real pain points — the gap between "interesting model" and "useful tool" is where projects die
- Cross-functional constraints (regulatory, IT infrastructure, data governance) are invisible until they block a project at month 4 — by then we've wasted 4 months of effort
- I spend 60% of my time translating between domains — if I could structure that translation, I'd free up time for actual strategy
- AIXplore generates more ideas than we can evaluate — I need a way to evaluate faster without losing rigor
