# Algorithm Preferences — Innovation Lead

## Default Effort
- Idea evaluations: THOROUGH (important, multi-domain, needs Council)
- Question generation: STANDARD (bounded, single-domain output)
- Response synthesis: THOROUGH (cross-domain, conflict detection)

## ISC Preferences
- Always include these ISC source types: EXPLICIT, INFERRED, IMPLICIT
- For idea evaluations, always create ISC rows for: scientific merit, implementation feasibility, ROI potential, risk assessment, timeline realism
- Tag ISC rows with domain: [SCIENCE], [DATA], [ORG], [REGULATORY]

## Thinking Tools Defaults
- Council: INCLUDE for any multi-perspective evaluation
- FirstPrinciples: INCLUDE when assumptions about data or feasibility are present
- RedTeam: INCLUDE only at DETERMINED effort or when explicitly requested
