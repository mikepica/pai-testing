# RefineIdea Workflow

## Trigger
User asks to refine, iterate, or adjust the idea based on synthesis.

## Algorithm Integration
Runs through The Algorithm at STANDARD effort.

## Process
1. Read the synthesis brief
2. Propose scope adjustments to address HARD constraints
3. Propose validation plans to test ASSUMPTIONs
4. Re-score the refined idea against original criteria
5. Track refinement iteration count

## LEARN Phase
Write to `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/` what adjustments were effective.
