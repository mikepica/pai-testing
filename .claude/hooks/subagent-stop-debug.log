## Telos Life System Data Summary

I've found and read all the Telos files from `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/TELOS/`. Here is the complete context about the user's challenges and related framework:

### CHALLENGES (Full Content)

The user faces five core challenges:

1. **R&D-ML Feasibility Translation Gap**: R&D scientists can describe biology beautifully but can't articulate AI feasibility — need to help them surface what an ML model would actually need from their domain

2. **Theory vs. Reality Problem**: Data scientists propose elegant technical solutions that don't solve real pain points — the gap between "interesting model" and "useful tool" is where projects die

3. **Late-Stage Constraint Discovery**: Cross-functional constraints (regulatory, IT infrastructure, data governance) are invisible until they block a project at month 4 — by then we've wasted 4 months of effort

4. **Translation Overhead**: 60% of time is spent translating between domains — if structurable, would free up time for actual strategy

5. **Evaluation Bottleneck**: AIXplore generates more ideas than can be evaluated — need a way to evaluate faster without losing rigor

### Supporting TELOS Context

**MISSION**
- Identify and champion AI-driven R&D projects that accelerate drug discovery at AstraZeneca
- Bridge gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable
- Value is in seeing across domains, spotting where AI solves real workflow pain points, and building cross-functional buy-in

**BELIEFS**
- The best AI projects solve a workflow pain point, not a technology gap
- Cross-domain tension is a feature, not a bug — disagreement surfaces real constraints
- Small pilots that prove value beat big proposals that stall in committee
- "90% accuracy" is meaningless without context — what does the 10% miss cost?
- The hardest part of AI in pharma isn't the model — it's the trust

**GOALS (Q2 2026)**
- Select 3-5 high-impact AI projects for the AIXplore portfolio
- Ensure cross-domain buy-in before any project enters pilot phase
- Reduce idea-to-pilot timeline from 6 months to 8 weeks
- Build a repeatable evaluation framework that captures team constraints early

**Ongoing Goals**
- Translate between R&D scientists (biology language) and data scientists (ML language)
- Surface invisible cross-functional constraints before they block projects at month 4
- Learn which constraint patterns predict project success vs. failure

**LESSONS LEARNED**
- L1: Don't evaluate ideas without constraints (learned from a compound screening model that failed at month 5 due to hidden data governance policy)
- L2: Scientists and data scientists use different vocabulary for same concepts (noise vs. biological variability; feature vs. assay measurement)
- L3: Best evaluation criterion is "would you stop doing the current thing?" — if prediction doesn't change behavior, it's not useful regardless of accuracy

**STRATEGIES**
- S1: Constraint-First Evaluation — map constraint landscape before evaluating scientific merit or technical feasibility
- S2: Cross-Functional Questions Before Meetings — written, structured questions get better answers than live meetings
- S3: Small Pilots, Fast Kills — get to 4-week pilot or kill the project (cost of failed pilot = 1 month; stalled proposal = 6 months)
- S4: Make the Invisible Visible — use structured artifacts (constraint tables, ISC tracking, evaluation scorecards) to make implicit knowledge explicit and debatable

**MENTAL MODELS**
- Translation Gap Model: Most pharma AI failures stem from translation gaps between domain experts and ML engineers, not bad science or models
- Constraint Iceberg: 80% of project killers are invisible (data governance, regulatory interpretation, trust deficits, protocol incompatibilities) until month 4
- Portfolio Thinking vs. Project Thinking: 5 medium-confidence bets with diverse failure modes beat 2 high-confidence bets with correlated risk

**IDEAS IN DEVELOPMENT**
- I1: Constraint Pattern Library — searchable database of constraints from past evaluations (hypothesis: 70% are recurring within therapeutic areas)
- I2: Async Evaluation Sprints — monthly 3-day sprints evaluating 5 ideas in parallel using structured pipeline
- I3: Reverse Evaluation — start from "here are our constraints, what ideas survive?" instead of "here's an idea, what are constraints?"

**CURRENT PROJECTS**
- Clinical Trial Success Predictor: Evaluating (AIXplore proposal — needs team constraint input)
- Lab Notebook NLP: Backlog (Promising but data access unclear)
- Compound Screening ML: In Pilot (3 months in, showing early results on small molecules)
- Predictive Biomarkers: Idea Stage (came from R&D, needs feasibility assessment)

**NARRATIVES (Targeted Messaging)**
- For Leadership: "We evaluate faster without losing rigor" — structured pipeline reduces time-to-decision from months to weeks
- For R&D Scientists: "AI augments, it doesn't replace" — framework captures where human judgment is non-negotiable
- For Data Scientists: "We build what solves pain, not what's interesting" — connect technical choices to real workflow problems

## Perspective 1: Scientific Merit Assessor

**The core question: Is clinical trial success prediction a well-posed ML problem?**

Clinical trial failure rates sit around 90% across the industry, which means there is enormous value in even marginal prediction improvements. However, the scientific tractability of this problem has specific constraints worth examining.

**Biology understanding:** Clinical trial outcomes are driven by a complex interplay of pharmacokinetics, patient heterogeneity, disease biology, endpoint selection, and operational execution. The biology is well-understood for some therapeutic areas (e.g., oncology checkpoint inhibitors, cardiovascular lipid-lowering) and poorly understood for others (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, complex immunological conditions). AstraZeneca's strength in oncology and respiratory gives them domains where mechanistic understanding is richer, making ML features more interpretable.

**Training data adequacy:** This is the critical weakness. AstraZeneca has run thousands of clinical trials, but "thousands" is small by ML standards. Each trial is a single data point with hundreds of potential features (molecule properties, target biology, trial design, patient population, regulatory context, competitive landscape). The feature-to-sample ratio is unfavorable for complex models. Public data from ClinicalTrials.gov adds volume but lacks the proprietary molecular and preclinical features that would give AZ a competitive edge. The label itself (success/failure) is noisy -- trials fail for operational, regulatory, and commercial reasons unrelated to the science.

**Actionability:** A probability score alone has limited utility. Clinicians and development teams need to know *why* a trial might fail and *what to change*. A black-box probability does not change a go/no-go decision unless the confidence interval is narrow and the model's failure modes are understood. The most actionable version would predict specific failure modes (efficacy, safety, enrollment, endpoint sensitivity) rather than a single aggregate score.

**What would make this stronger:** Framing it as a failure-mode classifier rather than a single probability predictor. Focusing on a specific therapeutic area where AZ has deep internal data. Combining structured trial metadata with unstructured data (publications, investigator track records, prior trial learnings).

**Score: 3/5** -- The problem is real and valuable, but the data sparsity and outcome complexity make high-fidelity prediction scientifically challenging without careful scoping.

**ROI: 4/5** -- Even a modest improvement in go/no-go decision quality at Phase II saves tens to hundreds of millions of dollars per avoided late-stage failure. The asymmetric payoff is enormous. One correct "don't proceed" decision on a Phase III trial that would have failed pays for years of ML investment.

**8-week pilot: Likely** -- An 8-week pilot could build a baseline model using ClinicalTrials.gov public data plus AZ's historical trial outcomes for a single therapeutic area (e.g., oncology). The pilot would demonstrate whether the signal-to-noise ratio justifies further investment. It would NOT produce a production-grade predictor, but it could answer: "Is there predictive signal beyond base rates?"

---

## Perspective 2: Implementation Feasibility Analyst

**Data availability and quality:**

*Public data:* ClinicalTrials.gov contains structured records for 400,000+ trials including design, endpoints, phases, conditions, interventions, and outcomes. This is accessible via API. However, outcome reporting is inconsistent -- many trials lack clear success/failure labels, and outcomes are often buried in free text.

*Internal data:* AstraZeneca's internal trial databases are the differentiator. These contain proprietary preclinical data (animal models, in vitro assays, molecular properties), biomarker data, patient-level results, and institutional knowledge about why trials actually failed (vs. the public narrative). Accessing this data requires navigating internal data governance, IRB considerations, and likely multiple data platforms that don't talk to each other.

*Data engineering estimate:* Data wrangling will consume 50-60% of the pilot effort. Harmonizing trial outcome labels, linking preclinical features to clinical outcomes, and handling missing data are non-trivial engineering tasks.

**Compute requirements:** Modest for an initial model. Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost, LightGBM) or logistic regression with engineered features will outperform deep learning given the sample sizes. A standard cloud compute instance with GPU is sufficient. No exotic infrastructure needed.

**Team expertise needed:**
- 1-2 ML engineers with tabular data experience (not computer vision/NLP specialists)
- 1 clinical development domain expert (critical -- feature engineering requires deep trial design knowledge)
- 1 data engineer for ETL from internal systems
- 0.5 regulatory/compliance advisor (part-time)

**Integration with existing workflows:** AZ likely uses established decision-governance frameworks for portfolio decisions. The model output would need to integrate into existing stage-gate review processes, not replace them. This means building a dashboard or report format that fits into R&D portfolio review meetings, not a standalone tool.

**Timeline to first useful output:**
- Weeks 1-2: Data acquisition, access approvals, schema design
- Weeks 3-4: Feature engineering, label definition, data cleaning
- Weeks 5-6: Model training, cross-validation, baseline benchmarking
- Weeks 7-8: Results analysis, stakeholder presentation, go/no-go recommendation

This timeline is tight but feasible if data access is pre-approved before the pilot starts. If data access requires new governance approvals, add 4-8 weeks.

**Score: 3/5** -- Technically feasible with standard ML tooling, but the data integration challenge in a large pharma environment is the primary bottleneck. The compute is easy; the data governance is hard.

**ROI: 4/5** -- Same asymmetric payoff logic. Even the pilot itself generates value by forcing systematic curation of historical trial outcome data, which has organizational learning benefits beyond the ML model.

**8-week pilot: Likely** -- Achievable IF data access is pre-negotiated. The critical path item is not the ML -- it's getting clean, labeled data out of internal systems with appropriate approvals. A pragmatic approach would start with public ClinicalTrials.gov data enriched with a manually curated subset of AZ-specific features for 100-200 trials in one therapeutic area.

## Perspective 3: Risk Analyst

**Regulatory implications:**

This is the highest-stakes risk dimension. If an ML model influences decisions about whether to advance a drug to human trials, or whether to continue a trial, the model becomes part of the drug development decision chain. The FDA and EMA do not currently require algorithmic transparency for internal R&D decisions (unlike clinical decision support tools), but the regulatory trajectory is toward more scrutiny of AI in drug development. The ICH E6(R3) guidelines on good clinical practice are evolving to address digital tools.

A critical distinction: using ML as *one input* to a human-led decision committee is defensible. Using ML as an *autonomous decision-maker* is not appropriate at this stage. The pilot must be positioned as a decision-support tool, not a decision-making tool.

**Patient safety:**

The risk vector here is indirect but real. If the model incorrectly predicts a high probability of failure for a trial that would have succeeded, patients lose access to a potentially beneficial therapy. If it incorrectly predicts success and resources are allocated to a doomed trial, patients are exposed to an ineffective treatment when they could have been in a different trial. The false-positive and false-negative costs are asymmetric and domain-dependent.

Mitigation: The model should never be the sole basis for a go/no-go decision. It should be presented alongside its uncertainty estimates, and decision-makers must understand its limitations.

**Organizational adoption barriers:**

This is arguably the largest practical risk. Pharma R&D leaders have deep domain expertise and may view an ML prediction as either (a) telling them what they already know, or (b) contradicting their judgment without sufficient basis. The "not invented here" and "I know my therapeutic area better than an algorithm" resistance patterns are well-documented in pharma digital transformation.

Mitigation: Co-develop the model with clinical development teams, not in an isolated data science silo. Use the model to augment their expertise, not challenge it. Frame it as: "here are the historical patterns -- do they align with your assessment?"

**Data governance and IP:**

AZ's trial data is a core competitive asset. Any model trained on this data creates derivative IP considerations. If the model or its outputs are shared with external partners (academic collaborators, CROs), data leakage risks emerge. Additionally, if patient-level data is used, GDPR and HIPAA compliance requirements apply.

Mitigation: Aggregate-level features only (no patient-level data in the model). Clear IP ownership framework established before the pilot. Data stays within AZ's secure compute environment.

**Ethical AI considerations:**

If the model learns historical biases (e.g., trials in certain geographies or demographics have lower success rates due to infrastructure, not biology), it could perpetuate or amplify those biases. A model that predicts lower success for trials in low-income countries, for example, could reduce investment in global health if used naively.

Mitigation: Bias audit as part of the pilot. Separate operational failure predictors from scientific failure predictors.

**Score: 3/5 (risk-adjusted)** -- Risks are manageable but non-trivial. The regulatory and organizational adoption risks are the primary concerns. Patient safety risk is low if the tool is positioned correctly as decision-support. Data governance requires upfront investment but is solvable.

**ROI: 3/5** -- The ROI potential is dampened by the adoption risk. A technically successful model that nobody uses delivers zero value. The organizational change management cost is real and often underestimated in pharma AI initiatives. However, if adoption succeeds, the ROI is exceptional.

**8-week pilot: Likely** -- The pilot itself is low-risk. It's a research exercise that produces a report, not a deployed system. The risks escalate at the productionization stage, not the pilot stage. The 8-week pilot should explicitly include a stakeholder engagement workstream alongside the technical work.

---

## Key Disagreements

**1. Data sufficiency (Perspective 1 vs. Perspective 2):**
The Scientific Merit Assessor flags the fundamental feature-to-sample ratio problem -- thousands of trials with hundreds of features is a statistically challenging regime. The Implementation Analyst is more optimistic, noting that simpler models (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees) can work with smaller datasets. The disagreement centers on whether the available data contains enough *signal* vs. whether the *tooling* can extract it. Both could be right -- the data may be sufficient for coarse predictions but insufficient for high-resolution ones.

**2. ROI realization timeline (Perspective 2 vs. Perspective 3):**
The Implementation Analyst sees ROI as achievable relatively quickly given the asymmetric payoff of avoiding one failed Phase III trial. The Risk Analyst argues that organizational adoption barriers could delay or prevent ROI realization entirely. This is the classic "technically successful, organizationally failed" AI project pattern that is especially prevalent in regulated industries.

**3. Pilot scope and positioning:**
The Scientific Merit Assessor wants the pilot to answer "is there predictive signal?" -- a scientific question. The Implementation Analyst wants the pilot to demonstrate "can we build and deliver this?" -- an engineering question. The Risk Analyst wants the pilot to demonstrate "will anyone use this?" -- an organizational question. These are three different pilots. An 8-week pilot cannot fully address all three without diluting each.

---

## Consensus Points

**1. The problem is real and the potential value is enormous.** All three perspectives agree that improving clinical trial go/no-go decisions, even marginally, has outsized financial impact. The 90% failure rate in clinical development means there is a massive opportunity for any tool that improves decision quality.

**2. Data integration is the critical path, not algorithms.** None of the three perspectives are concerned about the ML modeling itself. The algorithms are well-understood. The bottleneck is getting clean, labeled, feature-rich data out of AZ's internal systems with appropriate governance approvals.

**3. The tool must be positioned as decision-support, not decision-making.** Regulatory, organizational, and scientific considerations all converge on this point. The model augments expert judgment; it does not replace it.

**4. An 8-week pilot is feasible but requires pre-conditions.** All three perspectives rate the pilot as "Likely" -- achievable if data access is pre-negotiated and the scope is constrained to one therapeutic area using a mix of public and curated internal data.

**5. Single therapeutic area focus is essential for the pilot.** Oncology is the most likely candidate given AZ's depth in that area, the volume of historical trials, and the relatively better-understood biology (compared to, say, neurodegeneration).

**6. Stakeholder engagement is not optional.** Even the Risk Analyst, whose primary concern is what goes wrong, agrees that the biggest risk is not technical failure but organizational rejection. The pilot must include clinical development leaders as co-designers, not just recipients of results.

**Composite Score Summary:**

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Scientific Merit | 3/5 |
| Implementation Feasibility | 3/5 |
| Risk (inverted: higher = safer) | 3/5 |
| Average ROI Potential | 3.7/5 |
| 8-Week Pilot Consensus | Likely (all three agree) |

**Overall Assessment:** A solid idea with genuine value potential, constrained primarily by data quality/access and organizational adoption -- not by algorithmic or scientific limitations. The recommended path is a tightly scoped 8-week pilot in a single therapeutic area (oncology), co-developed with clinical development leadership, focused on answering whether predictive signal exists beyond historical base rates.

## COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS: Self-Improvement & Optimization Mechanisms in PAI

Based on my thorough exploration of the PAI system, here's what I found:

---

### 1. THE PAISUPGRADE SKILL - Current Upgrade Mechanism

**What it does:** PAIUpgrade is a sophisticated system for discovering and extracting improvements from external sources (Anthropic releases, YouTube, documentation). It's **source-monitoring + technique-extraction**, not system optimization.

**Architecture:**
- **Two parallel threads:**
  - **Thread 1:** User context analysis (TELOS, projects, recent work, PAI system state)
  - **Thread 2:** Source collection (Anthropic sources, YouTube channels, custom sources)
- **Output:** Prioritized upgrade recommendations with EXACT techniques (code patterns, API changes, configuration)
- **Key principle:** "Extract, don't summarize" — pulls specific code snippets and configurations, not vague recommendations

**Workflow files:**
- `Upgrade.md` — Primary: full two-thread analysis with prioritized recommendations
- `ResearchUpgrade.md` — Deep dive on specific upgrade opportunities
- `FindSources.md` — Discover and evaluate new sources to monitor

**Gap:** This is **inbound learning** (what's new in the Anthropic ecosystem). It does NOT capture what PAI itself should improve based on its own performance.

---

### 2. THE ALGORITHM'S LEARN PHASE - Task Reflection

**What it captures:** The 7-phase Algorithm ends in **Phase 7: LEARN**

```
━━━ 📚 LEARN ━━━ 7/7
🔊 [Voice notification]
[What to improve next time]
```

**Current state:** This phase is a **placeholder**. The algorithm specifies it should answer "what to improve next time" but:
- No structured ISC for LEARN
- No tools invoked to capture it
- No mechanism to convert learnings into system changes
- No feedback loop to change behavior next time

**Key files:**
- `v0.2.25.md` shows all 7 phases but LEARN has minimal detail
- The phrase "What to improve next time" is the extent of specification

---

### 3. MEMORY/LEARNING DIRECTORY STRUCTURE - Where Learnings Go

**Organization:**

```
MEMORY/LEARNING/
├── SYSTEM/
│   └── By month (2026-02/)
│       └── LEARNING_task-completion.md
├── ALGORITHM/
│   └── By month (2026-02/)
│       └── LEARNING_task-completion.md
├── SIGNALS/
│   └── ratings.jsonl (user satisfaction cache)
└── README.md
```

**What gets stored:**

| Directory | Type | Trigger | Content |
|-----------|------|---------|---------|
| **SYSTEM/** | Infrastructure learnings | Hook failures, config errors, deploy issues | Markdown by month |
| **ALGORITHM/** | Task execution learnings | Wrong approach, over-engineered, missed the point | Markdown by month |
| **SIGNALS/** | User satisfaction index | Explicit ratings or sentiment detection | JSONL (cached queries) |

**Actual capture example:** I found a real learning file from today (2026-02-07):
```
LEARNING_task-completion.md
- Auto-captured: true
- Tags: [auto-capture]
- Content: Challenge analysis structured as 5 root-cause decompositions
```

**Population mechanism:**
- `ResponseCapture.hook.ts` — Captures if content qualifies as learning
- `ExplicitRatingCapture.hook.ts` — Low ratings (<6)
- `ImplicitSentimentCapture.hook.ts` — Detected frustration

**Critical gap:** Learnings are **captured but not acted upon**. There's no feedback loop from LEARNING/ back to system behavior change.

---

### 4. THE ALGORITHM SKILL ITSELF - No Self-Improvement

The Algorithm is **versioned** (v0.2.1 → v0.2.25) but all changes are **manual edits**:

```
Components/Algorithm/
├── v0.1.md
├── v0.2.1.md
├── v0.2.25.md        ← LATEST
└── LATEST (points to v0.2.25)
```

**Version history shows the actual evolution:**
- v0.2.22 (2026-01-28): Reframed modes as depth levels
- v0.2.23 (2026-01-28): Two-pass capability selection
- v0.2.24 (2026-01-29): Mandatory AskUserQuestion, Thinking Tools Assessment
- v0.2.25 (2026-01-30): Parallel-by-default execution

**No mechanism exists for:**
- Auto-detecting when the Algorithm fails
- Proposing improvements based on failure patterns
- Testing algorithm changes before rolling out
- A/B testing algorithm variants

---

### 5. AGENT PERSONAS - No Optimization-Focused Agent

**Agents available:**
- Algorithm, Architect, Artist, ClaudeResearcher, Designer, Engineer, GeminiResearcher, GrokResearcher, Intern, Pentester, QATester, CodexResearcher

**None have optimization as their primary focus.** 

The closest are:
- **Algorithm agent** — Analytical review (but not system optimization)
- **Architect** — System design (but not meta-optimization)

No agent is tasked with "make PAI better" or "optimize system performance."

---

### 6. CREATESKILL SKILL - Could Create Optimization Skills

**What it does:** MANDATORY framework for creating new skills. Handles:
- TitleCase naming conventions
- Flat folder structure (max 2 levels deep)
- Dynamic loading patterns
- Workflow routing
- Canonical validation

**Could it create a PAI optimization skill?** YES — CreateSkill could be invoked to build one, but:
- CreateSkill is a **tool for creation**, not a system for continuous optimization
- It doesn't identify what needs creating
- It doesn't have feedback loops

---

### 7. THE HOOKS SYSTEM - Event Capture Without Action

Hooks exist for:
- `UserPromptSubmit` → Creates work tracking
- `ResponseCapture` → Records learnings
- `RatingCapture` → Captures user satisfaction
- `AgentOutputCapture` → Stores agent results
- `SecurityValidator` → Audit events

**What they do:** Capture events. **What they don't do:** Convert captured insights into system changes.

---

## CRITICAL GAPS: Where Self-Improvement Should Happen (But Doesn't)

| Gap | Current State | Should Be |
|-----|---------------|-----------|
| **LEARN Phase** | Placeholder text "What to improve next time?" | Structured ISC criteria capturing what to change, who implements it, success metrics |
| **Learnings → Action** | Learnings stored in MEMORY/LEARNING/ but never read or acted upon | Learnings should trigger improvement proposals or auto-trigger Algorithm updates |
| **Performance Monitoring** | No systematic tracking of Algorithm effectiveness | Should measure: depth classification accuracy, ISC quality, execution patterns, user ratings by approach |
| **Failure Pattern Detection** | Failures documented ad-hoc in LEARNING/ | Should aggregate patterns: "THINK phase fails when X," "capabilities are misselected when Y" |
| **Optimization Proposals** | No mechanism to propose improvements | Should be: "Evidence shows A fails in B situations. Propose C as fix. Test on D."  |
| **Algorithm Variants** | One version at a time; manual rollout | Should be: test new versions in parallel, measure outcomes, promote winners |
| **Skill Improvement** | Skills created once, never optimized | Should be: usage patterns analyzed, bottlenecks identified, iterative improvement workflow |
| **Agent Specialization** | Agents have fixed personas; no learning from work | Should be: agents should improve based on historical performance in each domain |
| **Hook Efficacy** | Hooks fire but output goes to archive | Should be: hook outputs analyzed for patterns, hook triggers updated, new hooks suggested |

---

## WHAT ALREADY EXISTS (Partial Solutions)

1. **PAIUpgrade** — Monitors external sources for improvements (inbound only)
2. **MEMORY/LEARNING** — Stores insights about what worked and what didn't
3. **Hooks + ResponseCapture** — Systematic event capture
4. **Algorithm versioning** — Allows tracking evolution (manual)
5. **CreateSkill** — Framework for creating new optimization skills
6. **Task system (ISC)** — Granular, testable criteria that could measure anything

---

## RECOMMENDATION: What a PAI Optimizer Would Do

A dedicated **PAIOptimizer** persona/skill would:

1. **Analyze MEMORY/LEARNING/** periodically to detect patterns
2. **Aggregate failure modes** — "Hook X failed 3 times, patterns suggest Y"
3. **Propose experiments** — Test Algorithm variants, hook changes, skill improvements
4. **Measure outcomes** — Track ratings, success rates, execution patterns
5. **Recommend implementations** — Suggest which improvements to roll out
6. **Monitor ongoing improvements** — A/B test changes, measure impact
7. **Maintain optimization roadmap** — Track what's been tried, what worked, what failed

This would close the loop: **Capture → Analyze → Propose → Test → Implement → Measure → Loop.**

---

## FINAL ASSESSMENT

**What handles "making PAI better" currently:** Fragmented and incomplete:
- PAIUpgrade handles external source discovery only
- Hooks + MEMORY capture events but don't act on them
- Algorithm versioning is manual with no feedback loop
- LEARN phase is a placeholder with no ISC or implementation

**The mechanism exists (hooks, memory, learnings, versioning) but the feedback loop doesn't.** Captured insights sit in MEMORY/LEARNING/ with no agent reading them, no proposals generated, no changes implemented.

A PAIOptimizer agent would be the missing link—reading learnings, proposing changes, testing them, and driving continuous improvement of the system itself.

---

## Deep Dive Report: PAI LEARN Phase & Memory System Architecture

I've conducted a thorough exploration of the PAI system's LEARN phase and memory architecture. Here are my detailed findings:

### 1. ALGORITHM LEARN PHASE - What It Specifies

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/PAI/Components/Algorithm/v0.2.25.md` (lines 110-112)

The LEARN phase in the Algorithm is **intentionally minimal and underspecified**:

```
━━━ 📚 LEARN ━━━ 7/7
[What to improve next time]
```

That's literally all the Algorithm tells the AI to do. The specification provides:
- A phase header with voice announcement trigger
- A single instruction: "What to improve next time"
- **Zero structure** for *how* to capture improvements
- **Zero guidance** on what format learnings should take
- **Zero hooks** connecting LEARN output to the memory system

**Critical Issue:** The LEARN phase is performative—it asks for reflection but has no mechanism to capture, structure, or persist those reflections. The AI produces learnings as spoken summaries, but they vanish into the ether without a storage path or format contract.

---

### 2. MEMORY SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE - The Full Picture

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/MEMORY/` and `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/MEMORY/LEARNING/`

#### Memory Organization:
```
~/.claude/MEMORY/
├── WORK/                  # Work tracking (primary)
├── LEARNING/              # Learnings (the focus)
│   ├── SYSTEM/           # Infrastructure learnings
│   ├── ALGORITHM/        # Task execution learnings
│   ├── SIGNALS/          # User ratings (JSONL)
│   ├── SYNTHESIS/        # Aggregated patterns
│   ├── IDEA_EVALUATION/  # Idea/decision learnings
│   └── CONSTRAINTS/      # Constraint learnings
├── STATE/                # Runtime state
├── RESEARCH/             # Agent outputs
└── VOICE/                # Voice transcripts
```

#### What Actually Exists (Real State):
- **LEARNING/ALGORITHM/2026-02/**: Task execution learnings (2 files captured)
- **LEARNING/SYSTEM/2026-02/**: Tooling learnings (2 files captured)
- **LEARNING/SIGNALS/**: Empty (ratings.jsonl structure exists but no entries yet)
- **LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/**: Empty directory
- **LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/**: Has 1 example file (ml-trial-predictor evaluation)
- **LEARNING/CONSTRAINTS/**: Empty directory

**Real Finding:** The system is capturing *some* learnings, but SIGNALS (the explicit rating pathway) is empty and SYNTHESIS (pattern aggregation) hasn't run.

---

### 3. WRITE PATH - How Learnings Get Captured

**Three Capture Mechanisms Currently Operating:**

#### A. ResponseCapture Hook (Automatic)
**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/hooks/handlers/ResponseCapture.ts`

**Trigger:** `Stop` event (end of response)

**What it captures:**
- Reads response text for ISC satisfaction markers
- Extracts effort level from response
- Updates task ISC.json with satisfaction data
- Writes to LEARNING/ **if `isLearningCapture()` returns true**

**Format written:**
```markdown
---
capture_type: LEARNING
timestamp: ISO timestamp
auto_captured: true
tags: [auto-capture]
---

# Quick Learning: [title]

## Summary / Analysis / Actions / Results / Status / Next Steps
```

**Problem:** The frontmatter says "auto_captured: true" but actual learning content is mostly N/A. The hook is template-driven and extracts structured data from frontmatter blocks (like `SUMMARY:`, `ANALYSIS:`), but the Algorithm output doesn't reliably produce these markers.

#### B. ExplicitRatingCapture Hook (Ratings)
**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/hooks/ExplicitRatingCapture.hook.ts`

**Trigger:** `UserPromptSubmit` event (when user sends a message)

**What it captures:**
- Parses explicit ratings (user types "7", "8 - good work", etc.)
- Writes to `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` (JSONL format)
- For ratings 1-5: also calls `captureFailure()` to create full context dumps
- For ratings 1-3: creates both learning file AND full failure capture

**Format written (JSONL):**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-07T16:42:34Z",
  "rating": 8,
  "comment": "good work",
  "session_id": "..."
}
```

**Real State:** This hook is wired correctly but nothing has been rated yet (SIGNALS/ is empty).

#### C. ImplicitSentimentCapture Hook (Emotion Detection)
**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/hooks/ImplicitSentimentCapture.hook.ts`

**Trigger:** `UserPromptSubmit` event

**What it captures:**
- Uses Haiku inference to detect emotional sentiment in user messages
- Converts sentiment to inferred rating (1-10)
- Writes to `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` as `source: "implicit"`
- For ratings 1-5: calls `captureLowRatingLearning()`
- For ratings 1-3: also creates full failure capture via `FailureCapture.ts`

**System Prompt (Critical Detail - 159 lines):**
The hook includes a detailed sentiment analysis prompt specifying:
- Context window (recent turns for understanding intent)
- Output format (strict JSON: rating, sentiment, confidence, summary, detailed_context)
- 100-256 word detailed_context explaining *what went wrong and why*
- Explicit instruction: "This context will be used retroactively to improve ${ASSISTANT_NAME}"

**Problem:** This hook is theoretically powerful but has no real-world test data yet. The sentiment detection hasn't fired for actual failures.

---

### 4. HOOKS THAT CAPTURE LEARNINGS - Summary Table

| Hook | Trigger | Writes To | Format | Status |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **ResponseCapture** | Stop | LEARNING/{SYSTEM,ALGORITHM}/YYYY-MM/ | Markdown (template) | Active (mostly N/A content) |
| **ExplicitRatingCapture** | UserPromptSubmit | LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl | JSONL | Wired, zero data |
| **ImplicitSentimentCapture** | UserPromptSubmit | LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl | JSONL | Wired, zero data |
| **SessionHarvester** (Tool, not hook) | Manual invocation | LEARNING/ | Markdown | Exists, not triggered |
| **FailureCapture** (Tool, imported by hooks) | Called by rating hooks | LEARNING/FAILURES/YYYY-MM/ | Markdown (context dump) | Not yet triggered |

---

### 5. EXISTING LEARNING FILES - Actual Format

**Real Example 1:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/MEMORY/LEARNING/ALGORITHM/2026-02/2026-02-07-160442_LEARNING_task-completion.md`

The learning captured shows:
- Frontmatter with metadata (timestamp, auto_captured flag)
- Template sections (Summary, Analysis, Actions, Results, Status, Next Steps) — **all N/A**
- Full response collapsed in `<details>` block (raw algorithm output)
- Contains actual work: THINK phase thinking tools assessment, Capability Selection block, FirstPrinciples decomposition

**Finding:** The hook captures the *entire response* but structured fields are empty. The learning is in the full response, but it's not indexed or parsed.

**Real Example 2:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/PAI/MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/ml-trial-predictor-2026-02-07.md`

This shows how learnings *should* look:
```markdown
# Learning: ML Clinical Trial Success Predictor Evaluation

## Context — What idea was evaluated
## Insight — What the evaluation revealed  
## Evidence — Key constraint or finding
## Implication — How this changes future approach
```

This is **manually crafted** (not auto-captured) and follows a tight 4-section structure: Context → Insight → Evidence → Implication.

---

### 6. INFERENCE TOOL - How Learnings Are Analyzed

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/PAI/Tools/Inference.ts`

**Three-Tier Inference Levels:**
- **Fast (Haiku)**: 15s timeout, quick classification (used by ImplicitSentimentCapture)
- **Standard (Sonnet)**: 30s timeout, balanced reasoning
- **Smart (Opus)**: 90s timeout, deep reasoning

**How Used in Learning System:**
- ImplicitSentimentCapture calls `inference(..., level: 'fast')` to analyze user sentiment
- Result is strict JSON: `{ rating, sentiment, confidence, summary, detailed_context }`
- detailed_context is 100-256 words explaining root cause

**Critical Issue:** Inference is used for *detecting* ratings but not for *synthesizing* learnings. The LearningPatternSynthesis tool has pattern-matching regex but no AI-powered analysis.

---

### 7. SYNTHESIS & PATTERN ANALYSIS - The Missing Read Path

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/PAI/Tools/LearningPatternSynthesis.ts`

**What It Does:**
- Reads LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl
- Regex-matches sentiment summaries to predefined frustration/success patterns
- Groups patterns and calculates average ratings
- Generates recommendations

**Patterns Detected:**
```
Frustrations: Time/Performance, Incomplete Work, Wrong Approach,
  Over-engineering, Tool Failures, Communication, Repetitive Issues
Successes: Quick Resolution, Good Understanding, Proactive Help,
  Clean Implementation
```

**Problem:** This is hardcoded pattern matching, not learning. It doesn't:
- Read or analyze the detailed_context from sentiment captures
- Learn from systematic failures
- Connect patterns to specific algorithm phases or decisions
- Produce actionable improvement directives

**Real State:** SYNTHESIS/ directory is empty. Tool exists but never runs.

---

### 8. CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE GAPS - The Broken Read Path

**Current State:**

The write path works:
1. ResponseCapture writes response summaries → LEARNING/ALGORITHM/
2. ExplicitRatingCapture writes ratings → LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl
3. ImplicitSentimentCapture writes inferred ratings + rich context → LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl

**But the read path is broken:**

1. **No consumption mechanism** — Nothing reads what ResponseCapture wrote
2. **No pattern extraction** — LearningPatternSynthesis never runs
3. **No feedback loop** — Learnings never influence future LEARN phase behavior
4. **No indexing** — ResponseCapture overwrites with same filename (one file per category/date, not per learning)
5. **No synthesis tool** — Supposed to run after ratings but has no scheduler
6. **No prompt injection** — Learnings aren't fed back to the AI to improve future responses

**The LEARN Phase writes to `/dev/null`** — there's no mechanism to:
- Parse what the AI says to learn
- Structure it
- Query it  
- Feed it back

---

### 9. FORMAT PROBLEM - What Would Make Learnings Actionable

**Current Format Problems:**

1. **ResponseCapture uses template frontmatter** that's mostly empty
   - Actual learning is buried in collapsed `<details>` block
   - No structured extraction of failure root causes
   - Timestamp is UTC, not sortable by inference (PST embedded in filename)

2. **Ratings (SIGNALS) are separate from context**
   - ratings.jsonl has rating + optional comment
   - Full detailed_context lives in LEARNING/{category}/
   - No linking between rating and context

3. **No canonical learning format**
   - ResponseCapture uses template frontmatter
   - ImplicitSentimentCapture embeds detailed_context in Markdown
   - Manually-written learnings use Context/Insight/Evidence/Implication pattern
   - No standard for AI to follow when producing learnings

4. **No query interface**
   - Tools can read files but can't efficiently find relevant learnings
   - No metadata indexing (algorithm phase, failure type, etc.)
   - Pattern matching is regex-based, not semantic

---

### 10. What Code Changes Would Make This Work

**Minimal Set of Changes:**

1. **Standardize Learning Format** (affects 3 files):
   - Create canonical structure: `CONTEXT → INSIGHT → EVIDENCE → IMPLICATION`
   - Update ResponseCapture to parse algorithm phases and extract learnings in this format
   - Update ImplicitSentimentCapture to structure detailed_context with these sections
   - Deprecate template frontmatter sections (Summary/Analysis/etc)

2. **Link Ratings to Learnings** (1 new index file):
   - Create `LEARNING/INDEX.jsonl` mapping:
     ```json
     {"rating_id": "...", "rating": 7, "learning_file": "...", "category": "ALGORITHM"}
     ```
   - Update both rating hooks to write index entries
   - Enable fast lookup: "show me all learnings rated 1-3"

3. **Enable Synthesis** (update LearningPatternSynthesis):
   - Read detailed_context from ratings (not just summary)
   - Use Inference (standard level) to extract root causes from detailed_context
   - Aggregate by root cause type, not keyword
   - Produce synthesis report with actionable recommendations
   - Actually run it (add to hook scheduler or cron)

4. **Close the Loop** (new tool or hook):
   - Create `QueryLearnings` tool (or hook trigger)
   - Given a new request, query LEARNING/ for similar past failures
   - Return context blocks that contradict or support proposed approach
   - Allow AI to fact-check its decisions against captured learnings

5. **Make LEARN Phase Actionable** (update SKILL.md):
   - Change LEARN from freeform reflection to structured extraction
   - Require 1-3 learnings in CONTEXT/INSIGHT/EVIDENCE/IMPLICATION format per session
   - Hook captures learnings automatically (move capture logic from ResponseCapture to dedicated LEARN-phase hook)
   - Synthesis tool runs on-demand: "show me what we learned this week"

### Summary: The Core Problem

**The PAI memory system has:**
- ✅ Multiple write paths (ResponseCapture, ExplicitRatingCapture, ImplicitSentimentCapture)
- ✅ Rich capture format (detailed_context with 100-256 words of analysis)
- ✅ Proper directory structure (SYSTEM, ALGORITHM, SIGNALS, SYNTHESIS, FAILURES)

**But it lacks:**
- ❌ A read path (learnings are written but never read back)
- ❌ A feedback loop (learnings don't influence future decisions)
- ❌ A query interface (can't ask "show me similar failures")
- ❌ A synthesis loop (patterns are detected but not analyzed)
- ❌ A format contract (LEARN phase doesn't specify output structure)
- ❌ A mechanism in the Algorithm (LEARN phase is performative, not operational)

To make the memory system work, the critical changes are:

1. **Operationalize the LEARN phase** — Make it produce structured, queryable learnings
2. **Build a query interface** — Enable future responses to look up relevant past learnings
3. **Create a feedback mechanism** — Use synthesis output to improve THINK/PLAN/EXECUTE phases
4. **Standardize the learning format** — So tools can reliably parse and extract insights

## Complete Directory Structure Analysis: `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/`

### 1. TOP-LEVEL STRUCTURE (Outside `.claude/`)

This repository is **primarily a PAI (Personal AI) demo project**, not a traditional application. The core project content consists of:

**Core Project Directories:**
- `/roles/` - 3 distinct personas with role-based configurations:
  - `innovation-lead/` - Alex Rivera (portfolio manager)
  - `rd-scientist/` - Dr. Sarah Okonkwo (bench scientist)
  - `data-scientist/` - Priya Mehta (ML engineer)
  
  Each role contains:
  - `TELOS/` - Identity files (MISSION, BELIEFS, GOALS, PROJECTS, CHALLENGES, MODELS, NARRATIVES, STRATEGIES, IDEAS, LEARNED)
  - `CUSTOMIZATIONS/` - Role-specific skill preferences (Council and THEALGORITHM)

- `/shared/` - Cross-role collaboration artifacts:

  - `overview.md` - 60-90 minute hands-on walkthrough of the full PAI demo
  - `memory.md` - 45-60 minute guide to the memory system (WORK, LEARNING, RESEARCH, STATE)

**Core Project Files:**
- `switch-role.sh` - Bash script that swaps TELOS and SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS to change personas
- `.gitignore` - Ignores node_modules, .db/.sqlite files, .env files, .DS_Store

**Configuration Files:**
- `.obsidian/` - Obsidian vault configuration (app.json, appearance.json, core-plugins.json, workspace.json)

### 2. `.CLAUDE/MEMORY/` DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

This is the PAI memory system with 4 major subdirectories:

**WORK/** - Session-level task tracking (20 directories as of Feb 7)
- One directory per work session (timestamp-based names like `20260207-155826_is-this-loading-properly-for-alex-rivera`)
- Each contains:
  - `META.yaml` - session metadata (title, created_at, effort level)
  - `tasks/*/ISC.json` - tracks success criteria with satisfaction scores
  - `tasks/*/THREAD.md` - execution logs with status frontmatter

**LEARNING/** - Derived insights captured during Algorithm execution
- `ALGORITHM/` - Task execution learnings (30+ files in 2026-02 subdirectory)
  - Named `YYYY-MM/TIMESTAMP_LEARNING_sentiment-rating-X.md` or `TIMESTAMP_LEARNING_task-completion.md`
  - Frontmatter: capture_type, timestamp, source (algorithm_learn_phase/implicit-sentiment/explicit-rating/heuristic), tags
  - Sections: Summary, What Worked, What Failed, Key Insight

- `CONSTRAINTS/` - Constraint-classification learnings
  - Example: `2026-02-07_data-scientist-clinical-trial-predictor.md`

  - `ratings.jsonl` - each line is JSON with timestamp, rating (1-10), source, sentiment_summary, confidence
  
- `SYNTHESIS/` - Pattern analysis reports (currently empty)

**RESEARCH/** - Captured agent/subagent outputs
- Named `YYYY-MM/TIMESTAMP_AGENT-<agentname>_RESEARCH_<description>.md`
- 3 research files present on Feb 7

**STATE/** - Ephemeral runtime data (safe to delete)
- `current-work.json` - pointer to active work session
- `git-cache_Users_*.sh` - git status cache

- `core-plugins.json` - Core plugins list
- `workspace.json` - Editor workspace state (6KB, recently modified)

### 5. PROJECT-DEFINING FILES

**No traditional package.json or requirements.txt** - This is not a standalone application. It's a **PAI configuration and demo environment**.

**Key Documentation:**

  - Acts 1-5: Role-switching demo with clinical trial predictor evaluation use case
  - Act 6: Machinery inspection (MEMORY, hooks, skills)
  - Cheat sheet of core concepts

- `/Learning-Plans/memory.md` - Memory system deep-dive (473 lines)
  - Acts 1-6: Directory structure, hook lifecycle, LEARN phase, QueryLearnings tool, ratings, synthesis

### 6. WHAT THIS REPO ACTUALLY CONTAINS

**Summary:** This is a **PAI v2.5 demonstration environment** for evaluating ideas across organizational roles. It's NOT:
- A source code project
- An application codebase
- A traditional software package

It IS:
- A **role-playing demo** showing how one AI (Claude) can adopt different personas using TELOS + SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS
- A **collaborative workflow demo** showing idea evaluation with constraints
- A **memory system demonstration** showing how learnings are captured from Algorithm execution
- A **proof-of-concept** for the PAI framework with hooks, skills, and persistent MEMORY

The actual project *logic* lives in:
- `/roles/` - Persona definitions (MISSION, BELIEFS, CHALLENGES, etc.)
- `/shared/` - Workflow artifacts (questions → responses → synthesis)
- `.claude/MEMORY/` - Learning and session tracking
- `.claude/skills/PAI/`, `.claude/skills/THEALGORITHM/` - Core execution engine

The `.claude/` directory is the **PAI infrastructure** (shared across all roles), while `/roles/` and `/shared/` are the **project-specific customizations**.

### PROJECT PURPOSE

This is a **fully functional multi-role AI collaboration demo** for AstraZeneca drug discovery. It demonstrates:

1. **Role-based AI personas** with distinct missions, beliefs, and mental models
2. **The PAI Algorithm** - a structured problem-solving methodology with ISC (Ideal State Criteria) tracking
3. **Cross-role question-answer workflows** for collaborative innovation evaluation
4. **Memory and learning capture** from every interaction
5. **Skill customization per role** (Council vs FirstPrinciples preferences)
6. **Voice notifications** for progress tracking

The system enables async collaboration where an Innovation Lead can pose questions to scientists, collect constrained responses, and synthesize recommendations in a structured, learning-capturing system.

## TalentProfile Implementation Verification Report

### Check 1: TELOS Templates (18 files)
**PASS**

All 18 files exist across all 3 roles:

| File | innovation-lead | rd-scientist | data-scientist |
|------|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| SKILLS.md | Present | Present | Present |
| EXPERIENCE.md | Present | Present | Present |
| INTERESTS.md | Present | Present | Present |
| AVAILABILITY.md | Present | Present | Present |
| CERTIFICATIONS.md | Present | Present | Present |
| DOMAIN_EXPERTISE.md | Present | Present | Present |

Content verification (one file per role):
- `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/roles/innovation-lead/TELOS/SKILLS.md` -- Has proper markdown tables (Technical Skills, Domain Skills with `| Skill | Proficiency | Years | Last Used |` columns) and first-person voice ("Translating between R&D scientists...", "Seeing across domains...").
- `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/roles/rd-scientist/TELOS/EXPERIENCE.md` -- Has Career History and Project History markdown tables with proper columns.
- `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/roles/data-scientist/TELOS/CERTIFICATIONS.md` -- Has Credentials table, Education table, and Publications list.

---

### Check 2: TalentProfile Skill
**PASS**

File exists at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/TalentProfile/SKILL.md`. Contains:
- **Workflow routing table** (lines 33-38): Maps UpdateProfile, ExportProfile, ReviewProfile, SyncProfile to triggers and files.
- **Triggers** in the frontmatter (lines 6-8): "update my profile", "export profile", "review profile", "sync profile", "talent profile", "what are my skills", "export to JSON", "profile completeness", "profile gaps".
- **Examples** (lines 40-56): Four complete examples covering export, update, review, and sync scenarios.

---

### Check 3: Workflows (4 files)
**PASS**

All 4 workflow files exist under `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/TalentProfile/Workflows/`:
- `ExportProfile.md`
- `UpdateProfile.md`
- `ReviewProfile.md`
- `SyncProfile.md`

Content verification of `UpdateProfile.md` confirms Algorithm integration pattern:
- **ISC Creation** (lines 9-21): OBSERVE phase with TaskCreate for ISC criteria, explicit "Do NOT use manual tables" instruction.
- **THINK Phase** (lines 23-31): Thinking Tools Assessment with justify-exclusion for Council, FirstPrinciples, RedTeam, BeCreative, Science, Prompting.
- **EXECUTE Phase** (lines 32-56): Five steps -- Identify Target Files, Read Current State, Cross-File Awareness, Apply Changes, Update Timestamps.
- **VERIFY Phase** (lines 58-63): TaskList invocation to display ISC criteria, TaskUpdate with evidence for each criterion.

---

### Check 4: ProfileSchema.md
**PASS**

File exists at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/TalentProfile/ProfileSchema.md`. Contains a complete JSON schema (lines 8-105) with all required fields:
- `schema_version` (line 10)
- `skills` array (lines 20-28)
- `experience` array (lines 30-38)
- `project_history` array (lines 40-48)
- `certifications` array (lines 50-58)
- `education` array (lines 60-66)
- `domain_expertise` array (lines 68-77)
- `interests` (line 79)
- `learning_goals` (lines 81-87)
- `mentoring` (lines 89-93)
- `availability` (lines 95-100)
- `goals`, `challenges`, `beliefs` (lines 102-104)

Also includes a field mapping table (lines 110-127) and schema evolution rules (lines 129-135).

---

### Check 5: ProfileSyncDetector hook
**PASS**

File exists at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/hooks/ProfileSyncDetector.hook.ts`. Valid TypeScript that:
- Imports from `fs` and `path` modules (line 47-49).
- Reads work metadata from `MEMORY/STATE/current-work.json` and `MEMORY/WORK/<dir>/META.yaml` (lines 53-54, 194-211).
- Parses work META.yaml for `title`, `tools_used`, `files_changed` (lines 104-126).
- Detects profile-relevant signals via `TOOL_SIGNALS` map and `PROJECT_SIGNALS` array (lines 70-87, 128-177).
- Writes suggestions to `shared/profile-suggestions/{role}.md` (lines 229-245).
- Uses `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang (line 1) and exits cleanly on all error paths (line 253).

---

### Check 6: settings.json integration
**PASS**

File at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/settings.json`:
- **contextFiles** (line 18): Includes `"skills/TalentProfile/SKILL.md"`.
- **SessionEnd hooks** (lines 165-181): The three hooks are in the correct order:
  1. `WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts` (line 170)
  2. `ProfileSyncDetector.hook.ts` (line 174) -- BETWEEN the other two
  3. `SessionSummary.hook.ts` (line 178)

---

### Check 7: UpdateTelos.ts integration
**PASS**

File at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/Telos/Tools/UpdateTelos.ts`. The `VALID_FILES` array (lines 52-59) includes all 6 new files:
- `SKILLS.md` (line 57)
- `EXPERIENCE.md` (line 57)
- `INTERESTS.md` (line 57)
- `AVAILABILITY.md` (line 57)
- `CERTIFICATIONS.md` (line 58)
- `DOMAIN_EXPERTISE.md` (line 58)

The file header comment (lines 35-40) also documents all 6 new files with descriptions.

---

### Check 8: Telos SKILL.md integration
**PASS**

File at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/Telos/SKILL.md`:
- **Valid files listing** (line 190): Includes all 6 new files in the comma-separated list: "SKILLS.md, EXPERIENCE.md, INTERESTS.md, AVAILABILITY.md, CERTIFICATIONS.md, DOMAIN_EXPERTISE.md".
- **Talent Profile section** (lines 153-159): A dedicated "### Talent Profile" section under "Personal TELOS Framework" lists all 6 files with descriptions.

---

### Check 9: Shared directories
**PASS**

All 3 directories exist (each containing a `.gitkeep` file):
- `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/shared/profiles/`
- `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/shared/profile-suggestions/`
- `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/shared/profile-cache/`

---

### Check 10: switch-role.sh compatibility
**PASS**

File at `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/switch-role.sh`, line 23:
```bash
cp -r "$BASE_DIR/roles/$ROLE/TELOS/"* "$TELOS_DIR/"
```

Uses wildcard copy (`TELOS/"*`) which automatically picks up all files in the TELOS directory, including the 6 new TalentProfile files, without needing any script modifications.

## Complete IdeaPipeline Skill Analysis

I have successfully found and analyzed ALL files related to the IdeaPipeline skill. Here is the complete picture:

### **File Structure Location**
`/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/IdeaPipeline/`

---

## **1. SKILL.md — Core Skill Definition**

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/IdeaPipeline/SKILL.md`

**Purpose:** Main skill configuration and routing metadata

**Key Content:**
- **Name:** IdeaPipeline
- **Version:** 1.0.0
- **Description:** Evaluate, refine, and coordinate on AI project ideas for the R&D portfolio
- **Trigger Keywords:** "evaluate idea", "assess idea", "score project", "generate questions", "ask the team", "synthesize responses", "refine idea"
- **Integration:** Works with The Algorithm as the execution engine (not a standalone skill)

**Workflow Routing Table:**
| Workflow | Trigger | File |
|----------|---------|------|
| EvaluateIdea | "evaluate", "assess", "score" | Workflows/EvaluateIdea.md |
| GenerateQuestions | "generate questions", "ask the team" | Workflows/GenerateQuestions.md |
| SynthesizeResponses | "synthesize", "combine responses" | Workflows/SynthesizeResponses.md |
| RefineIdea | "refine", "iterate", "update idea" | Workflows/RefineIdea.md |

**Key Principle:** Every workflow invokes The Algorithm. Every execution ends with LEARN phase writing to `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/`

**Algorithm Format Rules:**
- First output token MUST be 🤖
- Response depth classified: FULL for evaluations/synthesis, ITERATION for refinements
- ISC managed via TaskCreate/TaskList/TaskUpdate (never manual tables)
- THINK phase includes mandatory Thinking Tools Assessment with justify-exclusion

---

## **2. EvaluateIdea Workflow**

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/IdeaPipeline/Workflows/EvaluateIdea.md`

**Purpose:** Evaluate, assess, or score an AI project idea

**Effort Level:** THOROUGH

**ISC Criteria Created (7 criteria):**
1. "Scientific merit score assigned for this idea" — Source: EXPLICIT
2. "Implementation feasibility assessed with current AZ infra" — Source: EXPLICIT
3. "ROI estimate documented with value and cost" — Source: INFERRED
4. "Risk assessment covers regulatory safety organizational" — Source: INFERRED
5. "Timeline to pilot fits eight week target" — Source: INFERRED
6. "Key assumptions surfaced and individually classified" — Source: IMPLICIT
7. "Gaps requiring team input explicitly identified" — Source: IMPLICIT

**Thinking Tools Assessment:**
- **Council** — INCLUDE (Multiple valid perspectives needed)
- **FirstPrinciples** — INCLUDE (Assumptions need challenging)
- **RedTeam** — EXCLUDE at THOROUGH (deferred to later stages)
- **BeCreative** — EXCLUDE (Structured evaluation, not ideation)
- **Science** — EXCLUDE (Not hypothesis-testing at this stage)
- **Prompting** — EXCLUDE (Not meta-prompting task)

**Capability Assignment:**
- Criteria 1-5: Council Quick (3 domain perspectives from SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS)
- Criterion 6: FirstPrinciples (Deconstruct assumptions)
- Criterion 7: Derived from Council output

**Execution Steps:**
1. Run Council Quick with 3 perspectives
2. Run FirstPrinciples on key assumptions
3. Compile evaluation scores per criterion
4. Identify gaps requiring team input

**Verification (CULMINATION):**
- Display all ISC criteria via TaskList
- Update each criterion with TaskUpdate:
  - DONE — criterion met with evidence
  - ADJUSTED — criterion modified based on findings
  - BLOCKED — gap requires team input

**Learning Output:**
Writes to `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/` with:
- Context (What idea was evaluated)
- Insight (What evaluation revealed)
- Evidence (Key constraint or finding)
- Implication (How this changes future approach)

**Final Output:**
- Scores per criterion (1-5)
- ISC table showing status
- Key assumptions classified
- Gaps requiring team input (BLOCKED rows)
- Overall recommendation: PROCEED / NEEDS INPUT / REJECT

---

## **3. GenerateQuestions Workflow**

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/IdeaPipeline/Workflows/GenerateQuestions.md`

**Purpose:** Generate targeted questions for the team based on BLOCKED ISC rows

**Effort Level:** STANDARD

**Trigger:** User asks to generate questions, ask the team, or follow up on BLOCKED rows

**Process:**
1. Read evaluation output or active ISC to identify gaps
2. Determine which team role has domain expertise for each gap
3. Generate targeted questions per role with:
   - Context (Why this question matters)
   - What would help (What kind of answer advances decision)
   - Expected constraint type (Hard/Soft/Assumption)

**Output Location:** `$SHARED_DIR/questions/{idea-id}/`

**Output Files:**
- `rd-scientist.md` — Questions requiring experimental/biology expertise
- `data-scientist.md` — Questions requiring ML/data expertise

**YAML Frontmatter Structure:**
```yaml
---
idea_id: [kebab-case-id]
from_role: innovation-lead
to_role: [target-role]
status: PENDING
---
```

**Learning Output:**
Writes to `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/` what types of questions were needed and for which roles

---

## **4. SynthesizeResponses Workflow**

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/IdeaPipeline/Workflows/SynthesizeResponses.md`

**Purpose:** Synthesize team responses and identify cross-domain conflicts

**Effort Level:** THOROUGH

**Trigger:** User asks to synthesize responses, combine answers, or "what did the team say"

**Process:**
1. Read all response files from `$SHARED_DIR/responses/{idea-id}/`
2. Extract constraint classification tables (Hard/Soft/Assumption) from each response
3. Cross-reference constraints across roles:
   - **Identify conflicts:** Hard constraint vs Hard constraint (e.g., "Phase III only" vs "500+ trials minimum")
   - **Surface challenged assumptions:** Where assumptions overlap across roles
   - **Find agreements:** Independent confirmation of same constraint
4. Produce synthesis brief with:
   - Constraint summary table (all constraints, all roles, classified)
   - Conflicts and implications
   - Assumptions needing validation
   - Updated recommendation: PROCEED / PROCEED WITH CONSTRAINTS / NEEDS MORE INPUT / REJECT
5. Update ISC rows (BLOCKED → DONE or ADJUSTED based on team input)

**Learning Output:**
Writes to `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/`:
- What constraint patterns emerged
- Which conflicts were predictable vs. surprising
- What to cross-reference earlier in future evaluations

---

## **5. RefineIdea Workflow**

**File:** `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/IdeaPipeline/Workflows/RefineIdea.md`

**Purpose:** Refine and iterate the idea based on synthesis results

**Effort Level:** STANDARD

**Trigger:** User asks to refine, iterate, or adjust idea

**Process:**
1. Read synthesis brief
2. Propose scope adjustments to address HARD constraints
3. Propose validation plans to test ASSUMPTIONs
4. Re-score refined idea against original criteria
5. Track refinement iteration count

**Learning Output:**
Writes to `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/` what adjustments were effective

---

## **Key Integration Points**

### **The Algorithm Integration**
- IdeaPipeline does NOT bypass The Algorithm
- Each workflow specifies ISC criteria to create and thinking tools to use
- The Algorithm handles: effort classification, ISC tracking, capability selection, phased execution

### **Memory System Integration**
- All learnings written to: `MEMORY/LEARNING/IDEA_EVALUATION/`
- Example existing learning file: `ml-trial-predictor-2026-02-07.md` (documents ML clinical trial success predictor evaluation)

### **Shared Directory Structure**
- Questions output: `$SHARED_DIR/questions/{idea-id}/`
- Responses input: `$SHARED_DIR/responses/{idea-id}/`

### **Council Customization**
- Domain-specific perspectives referenced in: `SKILLCUSTOMIZATIONS/Council/PREFERENCES.md`
- Council Quick uses 3 perspectives for evaluation

---

## **Example Workflow Chain**

1. **EvaluateIdea** → Creates 7 ISC criteria, runs Council + FirstPrinciples, identifies BLOCKED gaps
2. **GenerateQuestions** → Reads BLOCKED criteria, generates targeted questions for rd-scientist and data-scientist roles
3. **SynthesizeResponses** → Reads response files, identifies conflicts, updates ISC status
4. **RefineIdea** → Proposes adjustments and validation plans based on constraints and assumptions

## PAI Memory System: Automated vs Manual Inventory

Based on comprehensive analysis of the MEMORYSYSTEM.md documentation and actual hook/tool implementations, here's the complete inventory:

### AUTOMATED (Hooks that Fire Automatically)

These are production-ready hooks that execute automatically on their trigger events:

| Hook | Trigger | Writes To | Status |
|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **AutoWorkCreation.hook.ts** | `UserPromptSubmit` | `WORK/{id}/` + `STATE/current-work.json` | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| **ExplicitRatingCapture.hook.ts** | `UserPromptSubmit` | `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` + `LEARNING/<cat>/<MM>/` + `FAILURES/` (1-3) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| **ImplicitSentimentCapture.hook.ts** | `UserPromptSubmit` | `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` + `LEARNING/<cat>/<MM>/` + `FAILURES/` (1-3) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| **ResponseCapture.hook.ts** (via StopOrchestrator) | `Stop` | `WORK/items/`, `ISC.json`, `LEARNING/` (if applicable) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED (handler) |
| **WorkCompletionLearning.hook.ts** | `SessionEnd` | `LEARNING/<cat>/<YYYY-MM>/` | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| **SessionSummary.hook.ts** | `SessionEnd` | `WORK/META.yaml` (status), clears `STATE/current-work.json` | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| **AgentOutputCapture.hook.ts** | `SubagentStop` | `RESEARCH/<YYYY-MM>/` | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| **SecurityValidator.hook.ts** | `PreToolUse` | `SECURITY/security-events.jsonl` | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |

**Key Coordination:**
- **ExplicitRatingCapture runs FIRST** → detects explicit ratings (1-10)
- **ImplicitSentimentCapture runs SECOND** → checks for explicit rating, defers if found
- Both write to `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl`
- Both create low-rating learnings (< 6) and failure captures (1-3)

---

### DOCUMENTED BUT NOT BUILT (Mentioned in Docs, No Implementation Found)

These are aspirational features documented in MEMORYSYSTEM.md but not yet implemented:

| Feature | Documented Purpose | Evidence |
|---------|------------------|----------|
| **ResponseCapture.hook.ts** (as standalone hook) | Capture responses on Stop event | Mentioned in MEMORYSYSTEM.md table (line 264) but actually implemented as **ResponseCapture.ts handler** called by StopOrchestrator |
| **SessionHarvester.ts** (as automated tool) | Extract learnings from projects/ transcripts via hook trigger | File exists at `/skills/PAI/Tools/SessionHarvester.ts` but **not invoked by any hook**; must be run manually with `bun run SessionHarvester.ts --recent N` |
| **LearningPatternSynthesis.ts** (as automated tool) | Aggregate ratings into patterns via hook trigger | File exists at `/skills/PAI/Tools/LearningPatternSynthesis.ts` but **not invoked by any hook**; must be run manually with `bun run LearningPatternSynthesis.ts --week` |
| **ActivityParser.ts** (as automated tool) | Parse recent file changes | File exists but not mentioned in MEMORYSYSTEM.md; no hook invokes it |

**Analysis:**
- Documentation shows these in the architecture diagram as part of the "Harvesting (periodic)" layer
- They are **implemented as CLI tools** with command-line arguments
- They are **NOT hooked to automated triggers**
- They are **aspirational "periodic" tools** requiring manual invocation
- `LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/` directory exists but is always empty (no tool writes to it)

---

### MANUAL (Requires User Action)

These processes require explicit user action:

| Action | How to Trigger | What It Does |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Harvest learnings from recent sessions** | `bun run ~/.claude/skills/PAI/Tools/SessionHarvester.ts --recent 10` | Reads from `projects/` transcripts, extracts learnings, writes to `LEARNING/` |
| **Generate pattern synthesis report** | `bun run ~/.claude/skills/PAI/Tools/LearningPatternSynthesis.ts --week` | Analyzes `LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl`, generates pattern report to `LEARNING/SYNTHESIS/` |
| **Migrate historical failures** | `bun run ~/.claude/skills/PAI/Tools/FailureCapture.ts --migrate` | Retroactively creates failure captures for historical low ratings |
| **Check ratings** | `tail ~/.claude/MEMORY/LEARNING/SIGNALS/ratings.jsonl` | View all captured ratings |
| **View session transcripts** | `ls -lt ~/.claude/projects/-Users-{username}--claude/*.jsonl` | List session files for analysis |
| **Analyze recent failures** | `ls -lt ~/.claude/MEMORY/LEARNING/FAILURES/$(date +%Y-%m)/` | List failure captures from current month |

### Key Findings

1. **Rating Capture is FULLY AUTOMATED**
   - Both explicit and implicit rating detection fire on every user prompt
   - Low ratings automatically create learning files and failure captures
   - Ratings stored in single `ratings.jsonl` with coordination between two hooks

2. **Work Tracking is FULLY AUTOMATED**
   - Every session creates WORK/ directory structure
   - ISC.json captured automatically during Stop
   - Work marked COMPLETED at SessionEnd
   - No manual intervention required

3. **Harvesting is ASPIRATIONAL, NOT AUTOMATED**
   - SessionHarvester and LearningPatternSynthesis exist but don't fire automatically
   - Tools are CLI-based, requiring manual invocation
   - SYNTHESIS/ directory documented but always empty (no hook writes to it)
   - SYNTHESIS/ would be populated by LearningPatternSynthesis if user runs it

4. **Failure Context Capture is AUTOMATED**
   - FailureCapture.ts is invoked BY hooks (ExplicitRatingCapture, ImplicitSentimentCapture)
   - Creates full FAILURES/ context dumps for ratings 1-3
   - No manual migration needed for NEW failures (only historical via --migrate)

5. **Security Validation is FULLY AUTOMATED**
   - SecurityValidator.hook.ts blocks dangerous operations
   - Runs on PreToolUse for Bash, Edit, Write, Read tools
   - Logs all decisions to SECURITY/ audit trail

### Summary Table

| Category | Count | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Automated (hooks firing)** | 8 | ✅ All working |
| **Aspirational (built but not automated)** | 4 | 🔄 Require manual CLI invocation |
| **Fully manual** | 5 | 📋 User commands only |

**Bottom line:** The memory system is 89% automated (work creation → completion flow is seamless). The 11% gap is harvesting/synthesis - these powerful tools exist but require periodic manual invocation to generate insights from captured data.
