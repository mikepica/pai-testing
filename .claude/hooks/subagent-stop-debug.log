## Telos Life System Data Summary

I've found and read all the Telos files from `/Users/mikepica/Personal_Projects/az-demo/.claude/skills/PAI/USER/TELOS/`. Here is the complete context about the user's challenges and related framework:

### CHALLENGES (Full Content)

The user faces five core challenges:

1. **R&D-ML Feasibility Translation Gap**: R&D scientists can describe biology beautifully but can't articulate AI feasibility — need to help them surface what an ML model would actually need from their domain

2. **Theory vs. Reality Problem**: Data scientists propose elegant technical solutions that don't solve real pain points — the gap between "interesting model" and "useful tool" is where projects die

3. **Late-Stage Constraint Discovery**: Cross-functional constraints (regulatory, IT infrastructure, data governance) are invisible until they block a project at month 4 — by then we've wasted 4 months of effort

4. **Translation Overhead**: 60% of time is spent translating between domains — if structurable, would free up time for actual strategy

5. **Evaluation Bottleneck**: AIXplore generates more ideas than can be evaluated — need a way to evaluate faster without losing rigor

### Supporting TELOS Context

**MISSION**
- Identify and champion AI-driven R&D projects that accelerate drug discovery at AstraZeneca
- Bridge gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable
- Value is in seeing across domains, spotting where AI solves real workflow pain points, and building cross-functional buy-in

**BELIEFS**
- The best AI projects solve a workflow pain point, not a technology gap
- Cross-domain tension is a feature, not a bug — disagreement surfaces real constraints
- Small pilots that prove value beat big proposals that stall in committee
- "90% accuracy" is meaningless without context — what does the 10% miss cost?
- The hardest part of AI in pharma isn't the model — it's the trust

**GOALS (Q2 2026)**
- Select 3-5 high-impact AI projects for the AIXplore portfolio
- Ensure cross-domain buy-in before any project enters pilot phase
- Reduce idea-to-pilot timeline from 6 months to 8 weeks
- Build a repeatable evaluation framework that captures team constraints early

**Ongoing Goals**
- Translate between R&D scientists (biology language) and data scientists (ML language)
- Surface invisible cross-functional constraints before they block projects at month 4
- Learn which constraint patterns predict project success vs. failure

**LESSONS LEARNED**
- L1: Don't evaluate ideas without constraints (learned from a compound screening model that failed at month 5 due to hidden data governance policy)
- L2: Scientists and data scientists use different vocabulary for same concepts (noise vs. biological variability; feature vs. assay measurement)
- L3: Best evaluation criterion is "would you stop doing the current thing?" — if prediction doesn't change behavior, it's not useful regardless of accuracy

**STRATEGIES**
- S1: Constraint-First Evaluation — map constraint landscape before evaluating scientific merit or technical feasibility
- S2: Cross-Functional Questions Before Meetings — written, structured questions get better answers than live meetings
- S3: Small Pilots, Fast Kills — get to 4-week pilot or kill the project (cost of failed pilot = 1 month; stalled proposal = 6 months)
- S4: Make the Invisible Visible — use structured artifacts (constraint tables, ISC tracking, evaluation scorecards) to make implicit knowledge explicit and debatable

**MENTAL MODELS**
- Translation Gap Model: Most pharma AI failures stem from translation gaps between domain experts and ML engineers, not bad science or models
- Constraint Iceberg: 80% of project killers are invisible (data governance, regulatory interpretation, trust deficits, protocol incompatibilities) until month 4
- Portfolio Thinking vs. Project Thinking: 5 medium-confidence bets with diverse failure modes beat 2 high-confidence bets with correlated risk

**IDEAS IN DEVELOPMENT**
- I1: Constraint Pattern Library — searchable database of constraints from past evaluations (hypothesis: 70% are recurring within therapeutic areas)
- I2: Async Evaluation Sprints — monthly 3-day sprints evaluating 5 ideas in parallel using structured pipeline
- I3: Reverse Evaluation — start from "here are our constraints, what ideas survive?" instead of "here's an idea, what are constraints?"

**CURRENT PROJECTS**
- Clinical Trial Success Predictor: Evaluating (AIXplore proposal — needs team constraint input)
- Lab Notebook NLP: Backlog (Promising but data access unclear)
- Compound Screening ML: In Pilot (3 months in, showing early results on small molecules)
- Predictive Biomarkers: Idea Stage (came from R&D, needs feasibility assessment)

**NARRATIVES (Targeted Messaging)**
- For Leadership: "We evaluate faster without losing rigor" — structured pipeline reduces time-to-decision from months to weeks
- For R&D Scientists: "AI augments, it doesn't replace" — framework captures where human judgment is non-negotiable
- For Data Scientists: "We build what solves pain, not what's interesting" — connect technical choices to real workflow problems

## Perspective 1: Scientific Merit Assessor

**The core question: Is clinical trial success prediction a well-posed ML problem?**

Clinical trial failure rates sit around 90% across the industry, which means there is enormous value in even marginal prediction improvements. However, the scientific tractability of this problem has specific constraints worth examining.

**Biology understanding:** Clinical trial outcomes are driven by a complex interplay of pharmacokinetics, patient heterogeneity, disease biology, endpoint selection, and operational execution. The biology is well-understood for some therapeutic areas (e.g., oncology checkpoint inhibitors, cardiovascular lipid-lowering) and poorly understood for others (e.g., neurodegenerative diseases, complex immunological conditions). AstraZeneca's strength in oncology and respiratory gives them domains where mechanistic understanding is richer, making ML features more interpretable.

**Training data adequacy:** This is the critical weakness. AstraZeneca has run thousands of clinical trials, but "thousands" is small by ML standards. Each trial is a single data point with hundreds of potential features (molecule properties, target biology, trial design, patient population, regulatory context, competitive landscape). The feature-to-sample ratio is unfavorable for complex models. Public data from ClinicalTrials.gov adds volume but lacks the proprietary molecular and preclinical features that would give AZ a competitive edge. The label itself (success/failure) is noisy -- trials fail for operational, regulatory, and commercial reasons unrelated to the science.

**Actionability:** A probability score alone has limited utility. Clinicians and development teams need to know *why* a trial might fail and *what to change*. A black-box probability does not change a go/no-go decision unless the confidence interval is narrow and the model's failure modes are understood. The most actionable version would predict specific failure modes (efficacy, safety, enrollment, endpoint sensitivity) rather than a single aggregate score.

**What would make this stronger:** Framing it as a failure-mode classifier rather than a single probability predictor. Focusing on a specific therapeutic area where AZ has deep internal data. Combining structured trial metadata with unstructured data (publications, investigator track records, prior trial learnings).

**Score: 3/5** -- The problem is real and valuable, but the data sparsity and outcome complexity make high-fidelity prediction scientifically challenging without careful scoping.

**ROI: 4/5** -- Even a modest improvement in go/no-go decision quality at Phase II saves tens to hundreds of millions of dollars per avoided late-stage failure. The asymmetric payoff is enormous. One correct "don't proceed" decision on a Phase III trial that would have failed pays for years of ML investment.

**8-week pilot: Likely** -- An 8-week pilot could build a baseline model using ClinicalTrials.gov public data plus AZ's historical trial outcomes for a single therapeutic area (e.g., oncology). The pilot would demonstrate whether the signal-to-noise ratio justifies further investment. It would NOT produce a production-grade predictor, but it could answer: "Is there predictive signal beyond base rates?"

---

## Perspective 2: Implementation Feasibility Analyst

**Data availability and quality:**

*Public data:* ClinicalTrials.gov contains structured records for 400,000+ trials including design, endpoints, phases, conditions, interventions, and outcomes. This is accessible via API. However, outcome reporting is inconsistent -- many trials lack clear success/failure labels, and outcomes are often buried in free text.

*Internal data:* AstraZeneca's internal trial databases are the differentiator. These contain proprietary preclinical data (animal models, in vitro assays, molecular properties), biomarker data, patient-level results, and institutional knowledge about why trials actually failed (vs. the public narrative). Accessing this data requires navigating internal data governance, IRB considerations, and likely multiple data platforms that don't talk to each other.

*Data engineering estimate:* Data wrangling will consume 50-60% of the pilot effort. Harmonizing trial outcome labels, linking preclinical features to clinical outcomes, and handling missing data are non-trivial engineering tasks.

**Compute requirements:** Modest for an initial model. Gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost, LightGBM) or logistic regression with engineered features will outperform deep learning given the sample sizes. A standard cloud compute instance with GPU is sufficient. No exotic infrastructure needed.

**Team expertise needed:**
- 1-2 ML engineers with tabular data experience (not computer vision/NLP specialists)
- 1 clinical development domain expert (critical -- feature engineering requires deep trial design knowledge)
- 1 data engineer for ETL from internal systems
- 0.5 regulatory/compliance advisor (part-time)

**Integration with existing workflows:** AZ likely uses established decision-governance frameworks for portfolio decisions. The model output would need to integrate into existing stage-gate review processes, not replace them. This means building a dashboard or report format that fits into R&D portfolio review meetings, not a standalone tool.

**Timeline to first useful output:**
- Weeks 1-2: Data acquisition, access approvals, schema design
- Weeks 3-4: Feature engineering, label definition, data cleaning
- Weeks 5-6: Model training, cross-validation, baseline benchmarking
- Weeks 7-8: Results analysis, stakeholder presentation, go/no-go recommendation

This timeline is tight but feasible if data access is pre-approved before the pilot starts. If data access requires new governance approvals, add 4-8 weeks.

**Score: 3/5** -- Technically feasible with standard ML tooling, but the data integration challenge in a large pharma environment is the primary bottleneck. The compute is easy; the data governance is hard.

**ROI: 4/5** -- Same asymmetric payoff logic. Even the pilot itself generates value by forcing systematic curation of historical trial outcome data, which has organizational learning benefits beyond the ML model.

**8-week pilot: Likely** -- Achievable IF data access is pre-negotiated. The critical path item is not the ML -- it's getting clean, labeled data out of internal systems with appropriate approvals. A pragmatic approach would start with public ClinicalTrials.gov data enriched with a manually curated subset of AZ-specific features for 100-200 trials in one therapeutic area.

## Perspective 3: Risk Analyst

**Regulatory implications:**

This is the highest-stakes risk dimension. If an ML model influences decisions about whether to advance a drug to human trials, or whether to continue a trial, the model becomes part of the drug development decision chain. The FDA and EMA do not currently require algorithmic transparency for internal R&D decisions (unlike clinical decision support tools), but the regulatory trajectory is toward more scrutiny of AI in drug development. The ICH E6(R3) guidelines on good clinical practice are evolving to address digital tools.

A critical distinction: using ML as *one input* to a human-led decision committee is defensible. Using ML as an *autonomous decision-maker* is not appropriate at this stage. The pilot must be positioned as a decision-support tool, not a decision-making tool.

**Patient safety:**

The risk vector here is indirect but real. If the model incorrectly predicts a high probability of failure for a trial that would have succeeded, patients lose access to a potentially beneficial therapy. If it incorrectly predicts success and resources are allocated to a doomed trial, patients are exposed to an ineffective treatment when they could have been in a different trial. The false-positive and false-negative costs are asymmetric and domain-dependent.

Mitigation: The model should never be the sole basis for a go/no-go decision. It should be presented alongside its uncertainty estimates, and decision-makers must understand its limitations.

**Organizational adoption barriers:**

This is arguably the largest practical risk. Pharma R&D leaders have deep domain expertise and may view an ML prediction as either (a) telling them what they already know, or (b) contradicting their judgment without sufficient basis. The "not invented here" and "I know my therapeutic area better than an algorithm" resistance patterns are well-documented in pharma digital transformation.

Mitigation: Co-develop the model with clinical development teams, not in an isolated data science silo. Use the model to augment their expertise, not challenge it. Frame it as: "here are the historical patterns -- do they align with your assessment?"

**Data governance and IP:**

AZ's trial data is a core competitive asset. Any model trained on this data creates derivative IP considerations. If the model or its outputs are shared with external partners (academic collaborators, CROs), data leakage risks emerge. Additionally, if patient-level data is used, GDPR and HIPAA compliance requirements apply.

Mitigation: Aggregate-level features only (no patient-level data in the model). Clear IP ownership framework established before the pilot. Data stays within AZ's secure compute environment.

**Ethical AI considerations:**

If the model learns historical biases (e.g., trials in certain geographies or demographics have lower success rates due to infrastructure, not biology), it could perpetuate or amplify those biases. A model that predicts lower success for trials in low-income countries, for example, could reduce investment in global health if used naively.

Mitigation: Bias audit as part of the pilot. Separate operational failure predictors from scientific failure predictors.

**Score: 3/5 (risk-adjusted)** -- Risks are manageable but non-trivial. The regulatory and organizational adoption risks are the primary concerns. Patient safety risk is low if the tool is positioned correctly as decision-support. Data governance requires upfront investment but is solvable.

**ROI: 3/5** -- The ROI potential is dampened by the adoption risk. A technically successful model that nobody uses delivers zero value. The organizational change management cost is real and often underestimated in pharma AI initiatives. However, if adoption succeeds, the ROI is exceptional.

**8-week pilot: Likely** -- The pilot itself is low-risk. It's a research exercise that produces a report, not a deployed system. The risks escalate at the productionization stage, not the pilot stage. The 8-week pilot should explicitly include a stakeholder engagement workstream alongside the technical work.

---

## Key Disagreements

**1. Data sufficiency (Perspective 1 vs. Perspective 2):**
The Scientific Merit Assessor flags the fundamental feature-to-sample ratio problem -- thousands of trials with hundreds of features is a statistically challenging regime. The Implementation Analyst is more optimistic, noting that simpler models (logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees) can work with smaller datasets. The disagreement centers on whether the available data contains enough *signal* vs. whether the *tooling* can extract it. Both could be right -- the data may be sufficient for coarse predictions but insufficient for high-resolution ones.

**2. ROI realization timeline (Perspective 2 vs. Perspective 3):**
The Implementation Analyst sees ROI as achievable relatively quickly given the asymmetric payoff of avoiding one failed Phase III trial. The Risk Analyst argues that organizational adoption barriers could delay or prevent ROI realization entirely. This is the classic "technically successful, organizationally failed" AI project pattern that is especially prevalent in regulated industries.

**3. Pilot scope and positioning:**
The Scientific Merit Assessor wants the pilot to answer "is there predictive signal?" -- a scientific question. The Implementation Analyst wants the pilot to demonstrate "can we build and deliver this?" -- an engineering question. The Risk Analyst wants the pilot to demonstrate "will anyone use this?" -- an organizational question. These are three different pilots. An 8-week pilot cannot fully address all three without diluting each.

---

## Consensus Points

**1. The problem is real and the potential value is enormous.** All three perspectives agree that improving clinical trial go/no-go decisions, even marginally, has outsized financial impact. The 90% failure rate in clinical development means there is a massive opportunity for any tool that improves decision quality.

**2. Data integration is the critical path, not algorithms.** None of the three perspectives are concerned about the ML modeling itself. The algorithms are well-understood. The bottleneck is getting clean, labeled, feature-rich data out of AZ's internal systems with appropriate governance approvals.

**3. The tool must be positioned as decision-support, not decision-making.** Regulatory, organizational, and scientific considerations all converge on this point. The model augments expert judgment; it does not replace it.

**4. An 8-week pilot is feasible but requires pre-conditions.** All three perspectives rate the pilot as "Likely" -- achievable if data access is pre-negotiated and the scope is constrained to one therapeutic area using a mix of public and curated internal data.

**5. Single therapeutic area focus is essential for the pilot.** Oncology is the most likely candidate given AZ's depth in that area, the volume of historical trials, and the relatively better-understood biology (compared to, say, neurodegeneration).

**6. Stakeholder engagement is not optional.** Even the Risk Analyst, whose primary concern is what goes wrong, agrees that the biggest risk is not technical failure but organizational rejection. The pilot must include clinical development leaders as co-designers, not just recipients of results.

**Composite Score Summary:**

| Dimension | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Scientific Merit | 3/5 |
| Implementation Feasibility | 3/5 |
| Risk (inverted: higher = safer) | 3/5 |
| Average ROI Potential | 3.7/5 |
