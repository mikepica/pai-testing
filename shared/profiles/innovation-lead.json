  "narrative": {
    "summary": "An AI Innovation Lead at AstraZeneca who sits at the intersection of biology, machine learning, and organizational strategy. With 8 years in pharma R&D operations and 5 years focused on AI strategy, they specialize in identifying which AI opportunities will actually work in a regulated healthcare environment — and building the cross-functional buy-in to get them from idea to pilot. Their distinctive value is not in building models, but in judgment: knowing what to build, what's safe to build, and how to get a 10,000-person organization to actually adopt it.",
    "mission": "I identify the highest-value AI opportunities in our enterprise, prove they work through code-assisted prototypes, and orchestrate the organization to adopt them. I bridge the gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable.",
    "value_proposition": "Uniquely positioned at the intersection of domains that rarely talk to each other — translating between biology and ML, filtering ideas through regulatory and feasibility lenses before investing effort, and building the trust-based relationships that convert prototypes into funded programs. In a world where anyone can build an AI prototype, the scarce skills are judgment about what to build, governance about what's safe, and influence to drive adoption. That's the core offering.",
    "trajectory": "Currently an IC-level AI Innovation Lead, building toward Sr. AI Strategy Lead (3-5 years), then Director/VP AI Strategy (5-8 years), with a long-term trajectory toward Chief AI/Innovation Officer (8-12 years). Near-term focus is on building hands-on prototype credibility (code-assisted demos with LLM APIs and agentic frameworks) while deepening governance expertise to become the enterprise authority on 'can we do this safely?'",
    "operating_principles": [
      "The best AI projects solve a workflow pain point, not a technology gap",
      "Cross-domain tension is a feature, not a bug — disagreement surfaces real constraints",
      "Small pilots that prove value beat big proposals that stall in committee",
      "'90% accuracy' is meaningless without context — what does the 10% miss cost?",
      "The hardest part of AI in pharma isn't the model — it's the trust"
    ],
    "domain_intersections": [
      "Biology x ML — translates between what scientists need and what models can deliver",
      "Strategy x Technical Feasibility — filters ideas that are interesting but not achievable",
      "Regulatory x Innovation — flags compliance constraints before they block projects at month 4",
      "Technology x Organizational Change — understands not just what to build, but how to get 10,000 people to actually use it",
      "Domain Expertise x AI Judgment — when AI prototyping is commoditized, deep domain knowledge + strategic judgment becomes the differentiator"
    ],
    "challenges_they_solve": [
      "R&D scientists can describe biology but can't articulate AI feasibility — helps them surface what an ML model would actually need from their domain",
      "Data scientists propose elegant technical solutions that don't solve real pain points — bridges the gap between 'interesting model' and 'useful tool'",
      "Cross-functional constraints (regulatory, IT infrastructure, data governance) are invisible until they block a project at month 4 — surfaces them early",
      "60% of time spent translating between domains — structuring that translation to free up time for strategy",
      "AIXplore generates more ideas than can be evaluated — building faster evaluation without losing rigor"
    ]
