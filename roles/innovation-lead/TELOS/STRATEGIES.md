# Strategies

## S1: Constraint-First Evaluation
Before evaluating scientific merit or technical feasibility, map the constraint landscape. A brilliant idea with an immovable regulatory constraint is worse than a modest idea with a clear path.

## S2: Cross-Functional Questions Before Cross-Functional Meetings
Written, structured questions get better answers than live meetings. People think more carefully when they write. Send questions → collect responses → synthesize → then meet only to resolve conflicts.

## S3: Small Pilots, Fast Kills
Get to a 4-week pilot or kill the project. The cost of a failed pilot is one month. The cost of a stalled committee proposal is six months of everyone's time.

## S4: Make the Invisible Visible
Use structured artifacts (constraint tables, ISC tracking, evaluation scorecards) so that implicit knowledge becomes explicit and debatable.
