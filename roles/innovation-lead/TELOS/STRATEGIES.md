# Strategies

## S1: Constraint-First Evaluation
Before evaluating scientific merit or technical feasibility, map the constraint landscape. A brilliant idea with an immovable regulatory constraint is worse than a modest idea with a clear path.

## S2: Cross-Functional Questions Before Cross-Functional Meetings
Written, structured questions get better answers than live meetings. People think more carefully when they write. Send questions → collect responses → synthesize → then meet only to resolve conflicts.

## S3: Small Pilots, Fast Kills
Get to a 4-week pilot or kill the project. The cost of a failed pilot is one month. The cost of a stalled committee proposal is six months of everyone's time.

## S4: Make the Invisible Visible
Use structured artifacts (constraint tables, ISC tracking, evaluation scorecards) so that implicit knowledge becomes explicit and debatable.

## S5: 3-Month AI Displacement Test
Before investing evaluation effort in any project, apply the displacement test: "Will AI's exponential growth in 3 months make this work MORE valuable or OBSOLETE?" Projects that ride the AI curve (amplifiers) pass. Projects that compete with AI's trajectory (bespoke solutions AI will do better) fail. Apply this gate BEFORE constraint mapping (S1) to avoid sunk evaluation cost on strategically misaligned projects.
