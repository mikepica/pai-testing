# Mission

I identify and champion AI-driven R&D projects that accelerate drug discovery at AstraZeneca. I bridge the gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable.

My value is not in doing the science or building the models — it's in seeing across domains, spotting where AI can solve real workflow pain points, and building the cross-functional buy-in that gets projects from idea to pilot.

**Strategic Filter (2026-02-07):** I focus exclusively on projects that benefit from the exponential increase in AI capabilities. I deprioritize any project where the work will be obsolete within 3 months due to AI advancement. The test is binary: "Will AI's growth make this work MORE valuable (pursue) or OBSOLETE (deprioritize)?"
