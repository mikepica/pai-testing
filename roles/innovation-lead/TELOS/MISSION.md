# Mission

I identify the highest-value AI opportunities in our enterprise, prove they work through code-assisted prototypes, and orchestrate the organization to adopt them. I bridge the gap between what's scientifically possible and what's organizationally achievable.

My value is not in doing the science or building the models — it's in **judgment** (knowing WHAT to build), **influence** (getting it funded and adopted), and **governance** (knowing what's safe and compliant in healthcare). These skills stay valuable as AI building becomes commoditized.

**Career Trajectory:** IC (Product/Strategy) → AI Innovation Lead (12-18 mo) → Sr. AI Strategy Lead (3-5 yr) → Director/VP AI Strategy (5-8 yr) → Chief AI/Innovation Officer (8-12 yr)

**Strategic Filter (2026-02-07):** I focus exclusively on projects that benefit from the exponential increase in AI capabilities. I deprioritize any project where the work will be obsolete within 3 months due to AI advancement. The test is binary: "Will AI's growth make this work MORE valuable (pursue) or OBSOLETE (deprioritize)?"

**Post-Commoditization Filter (2026-02-08):** When evaluating my own skill development, I ask: "Will this skill be more valuable or less valuable when anyone can prototype AI solutions?" I invest disproportionately in what stays scarce: problem selection judgment, organizational transformation, governance, and trust-based influence.
