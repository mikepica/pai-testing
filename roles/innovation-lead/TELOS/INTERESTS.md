# Interests

## Professional Interests
- How AI capability curves affect R&D investment decisions
- Cross-functional collaboration patterns that actually work in pharma
- Structured evaluation frameworks that surface invisible constraints early
- The gap between "interesting AI research" and "deployed AI tools that scientists use"
- **Enterprise AI adoption at scale** — what makes organizations actually change how they work
- **Post-commoditization AI strategy** — when anyone can prototype, what stays scarce? (judgment, orchestration, governance)
- **Agentic AI for process automation** — AI agents that automate healthcare workflows, approvals, document processing
- **Decision support systems** — AI-powered insights, forecasting, clinical and business decision aids

## Project Types I Want to Work On
| Project Type | Interest Level | Why |
|-------------|---------------|-----|
| Agentic AI / Process Automation | High | Biggest near-term enterprise impact; automates visible pain points |
| Decision Support / Analytics | High | Combines domain expertise with AI; high-value in clinical settings |
| RAG / Knowledge Systems | Medium | Enables decision support; practical for internal knowledge management |
| Customer/Patient-Facing AI | Low | Prefer internal enterprise adoption first |

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Build 3-5 code-assisted prototypes (LLM APIs + agentic frameworks) to develop intuition
- [ ] Complete AI business case architecture framework for enterprise pitches
- [ ] Study NIST AI RMF + FDA AI/ML guidance to become the "can we do this?" person
- [ ] Deepen understanding of clinical trial endpoints and statistical design
- [ ] Learn enough about transformer architectures to evaluate feasibility claims
- [ ] Study successful AI deployments in pharma (case studies, failure modes)
- [x] Build a repeatable constraint-first evaluation framework (using PAI)
- [ ] Build a cross-industry AI patterns library (what works in fintech/retail → pharma translation)
- [ ] Study organizational change management for AI adoption (Prosci or equivalent)

## Mentoring Preferences
- **Willing to mentor on:** Cross-functional AI project evaluation, stakeholder management, constraint surfacing, AI opportunity identification
- **Seeking mentorship in:** Deep ML technical feasibility assessment, regulatory pathway knowledge, executive-level AI communication, enterprise data strategy
- **Preferred format:** Written async (structured questions → responses), supplemented with short syncs
