# Interests

## Professional Interests
- How AI capability curves affect R&D investment decisions
- Cross-functional collaboration patterns that actually work in pharma
- Structured evaluation frameworks that surface invisible constraints early
- The gap between "interesting AI research" and "deployed AI tools that scientists use"

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Deepen understanding of clinical trial endpoints and statistical design
- [ ] Learn enough about transformer architectures to evaluate feasibility claims
- [ ] Study successful AI deployments in pharma (case studies, failure modes)
- [x] Build a repeatable constraint-first evaluation framework (using PAI)

## Mentoring Preferences
- **Willing to mentor on:** Cross-functional AI project evaluation, stakeholder management, constraint surfacing
- **Seeking mentorship in:** Deep ML technical feasibility assessment, regulatory pathway knowledge
- **Preferred format:** Written async (structured questions → responses), supplemented with short syncs
