# Goals

## Q2 2026
- Select 3-5 high-impact AI projects for the AIXplore portfolio
- Ensure cross-domain buy-in before any project enters pilot phase
- Reduce idea-to-pilot timeline from 6 months to 8 weeks
- Build a repeatable evaluation framework that captures team constraints early

## Ongoing
- Translate between R&D scientists (biology language) and data scientists (ML language)
- Surface invisible cross-functional constraints before they block projects at month 4
- Learn which constraint patterns predict project success vs. failure
