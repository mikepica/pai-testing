# Goals

## Career Transition Goal (2026-2027)
**Target Role:** AI Innovation Lead — the person who identifies the highest-value AI opportunities, proves they work, and orchestrates the organization to adopt them.

**Positioning Statement:** "I identify the highest-value AI opportunities in our enterprise, prove they work, and orchestrate the organization to adopt them." — This statement stays true whether prototyping takes 2 weeks or 2 hours.

## Q2 2026
- Select 3-5 high-impact AI projects for the AIXplore portfolio
- Ensure cross-domain buy-in before any project enters pilot phase
- Reduce idea-to-pilot timeline from 6 months to 8 weeks
- Build a repeatable evaluation framework that captures team constraints early
- Build 2 code-assisted prototypes (agentic AI + decision support) as proof of capability
- Develop AI business case template and pitch it to at least one VP sponsor

## Q3-Q4 2026
- Complete Tier 1 skills development (prompt engineering, agentic frameworks, AI governance, business case architecture)
- Launch at least 1 AI prototype that earns investment approval and handoff to delivery team
- Begin Tier 2 skills (change management, cross-domain patterns, data strategy, vendor evaluation)
- Build a "wins log" documenting every prototype, demo, and stakeholder reaction

## 2027
- Establish yourself as the enterprise go-to for "should we build this AI solution?"
- Begin Tier 3 skills (board-level communication, AI portfolio management, enterprise architecture)
- Start building external thought leadership (internal talks → conference talks → published insights)

## Ongoing
- Translate between R&D scientists (biology language) and data scientists (ML language)
- Surface invisible cross-functional constraints before they block projects at month 4
- Learn which constraint patterns predict project success vs. failure
- Apply the "what stays scarce" filter: prioritize skills and projects around judgment, orchestration, and governance over pure technical implementation
