# Ideas

## I1: Constraint Pattern Library
Build a searchable database of constraints from past evaluations. Hypothesis: 70% of constraints are recurring across projects in the same therapeutic area. If true, we could pre-populate constraint maps.

## I2: Async Evaluation Sprints
Instead of one-off evaluations, run monthly 3-day sprints where the team evaluates 5 ideas in parallel using the structured pipeline. Batch processing might be more efficient than one-at-a-time.

## I3: Reverse Evaluation — Start From Constraints
Instead of "here's an idea, what are the constraints?", start from "here are our current constraints, what ideas survive them?" Invert the pipeline.
