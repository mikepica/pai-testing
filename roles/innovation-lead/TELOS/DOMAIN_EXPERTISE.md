# Domain Expertise

## Primary Domains

| Domain | Depth | Years | Specific Areas | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|----------|
| AI/ML in Drug Discovery | Advanced | 5 | Project selection, feasibility assessment, portfolio management | Primary |
| Pharmaceutical R&D Operations | Advanced | 8 | Cross-functional coordination, stakeholder alignment, constraint surfacing | Primary |

## Secondary Domains

| Domain | Depth | Years | Specific Areas | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Clinical Trials | Foundational | 2 | Endpoint concepts, trial phases, regulatory awareness | Supporting |
| Data Science (Concepts) | Intermediate | 3 | Model evaluation, explainability requirements, data quality assessment | Supporting |
| Regulatory Affairs | Foundational | 2 | FDA/EMA submission awareness, GDPR data governance | Supporting |

## Domains to Develop

| Domain | Current | Target | Timeline | Why |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|-----|
| Agentic AI / Process Automation | Foundational | Intermediate | Q2-Q3 2026 | Top project interest; must demo credibly |
| Enterprise AI Governance | Foundational | Intermediate | Q2-Q3 2026 | Healthcare = regulated; be the "can we do this?" authority |
| Organizational Change Management | None | Intermediate | Q3-Q4 2026 | The bottleneck when everyone can build; adoption > implementation |
| Enterprise Data Strategy | Foundational | Intermediate | Q3-Q4 2026 | Data moats > model moats; know the enterprise data landscape |
| AI Portfolio Management | None | Intermediate | 2027 | Manage AI bets like a VC; executive trajectory skill |

## Domain Intersections
I sit at the intersection of domains that rarely talk to each other:
- **Biology x ML:** I translate between what scientists need and what models can deliver
- **Strategy x Technical Feasibility:** I filter ideas that are interesting but not achievable
- **Regulatory x Innovation:** I flag compliance constraints before they block projects at month 4
- **Technology x Organizational Change:** I understand not just what to build, but how to get 10,000 people to actually use it
- **Domain Expertise x AI Judgment:** When AI prototyping is commoditized, deep domain knowledge + strategic judgment becomes the differentiator
