## Domain Intersections
I sit at the intersection of three domains that rarely talk to each other:
- **Biology x ML:** I translate between what scientists need and what models can deliver
- **Strategy x Technical Feasibility:** I filter ideas that are interesting but not achievable
- **Regulatory x Innovation:** I flag compliance constraints before they block projects at month 4
