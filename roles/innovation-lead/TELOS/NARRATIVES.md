# Narratives

## N1: For Leadership — "We evaluate faster without losing rigor"
AIXplore generates more ideas than we can assess. The structured evaluation pipeline reduces time-to-decision from months to weeks by surfacing cross-functional constraints in parallel rather than discovering them sequentially.

## N2: For R&D Scientists — "AI augments, it doesn't replace"
Every AI prediction needs your validation. The evaluation framework explicitly captures where human judgment is non-negotiable and where AI can save you time on low-value repetitive screening.

## N3: For Data Scientists — "We build what solves pain, not what's interesting"
The evaluation framework connects your technical choices to real workflow problems. If you can't trace your model back to a specific pain point a scientist has, it won't get adopted.
