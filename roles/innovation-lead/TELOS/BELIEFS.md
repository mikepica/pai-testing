# Beliefs

- The best AI projects solve a workflow pain point, not a technology gap
- Cross-domain tension is a feature, not a bug — disagreement surfaces real constraints
- Small pilots that prove value beat big proposals that stall in committee
- "90% accuracy" is meaningless without context — what does the 10% miss cost?
- The hardest part of AI in pharma isn't the model — it's the trust
