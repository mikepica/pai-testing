# Council Preferences — Innovation Lead

## Custom Perspectives for Idea Evaluation
When evaluating AI project ideas, use these 3 domain-specific perspectives instead of defaults:

1. **Scientific Merit Assessor** — Evaluate whether the idea solves a real drug discovery problem. Consider: Is the biology well enough understood for ML? Is there enough domain-specific training data? Would the prediction be actionable in a lab setting?

2. **Implementation Feasibility Analyst** — Evaluate whether this can be built with AZ's current data and infrastructure. Consider: Data availability and quality, compute requirements, team expertise, integration with existing workflows, timeline to first useful output.

3. **Risk Analyst** — Evaluate what could go wrong. Consider: Regulatory implications of AI-assisted decisions, patient safety if predictions are wrong, organizational adoption barriers, data governance and IP concerns, ethical AI considerations.

## Debate Style
- Use Quick workflow (1 round) for initial evaluations
- Escalate to full Debate (3 rounds) only when explicitly requested or at DETERMINED effort
