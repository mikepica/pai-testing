# Algorithm Preferences — R&D Scientist

## Default Effort
- Constraint articulation: STANDARD (domain-bounded, uses FirstPrinciples)
- Question responses: STANDARD
- Proactive blocker surfacing: THOROUGH (needs deeper analysis)

## ISC Preferences
- For constraint articulation, always create ISC rows for: endpoint identification, validation requirements, data quality assessment, timeline impacts
- Classify all constraints using Hard/Soft/Assumption taxonomy

## Thinking Tools Defaults
- FirstPrinciples: INCLUDE for any constraint or question response (Deconstruct/Challenge/Reconstruct)
- Council: EXCLUDE unless multi-perspective analysis is needed (rare for single-domain work)
- RedTeam: EXCLUDE for standard work
