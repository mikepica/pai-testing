# Domain Expertise

## Primary Domains

| Domain | Depth | Years | Specific Areas | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Immuno-oncology | Expert | 10 | Checkpoint inhibitors, durvalumab, PD-L1 biology | Primary |
| Translational Assay Validation | Expert | 12 | Biomarker assays, flow cytometry, IHC, cell viability | Primary |

## Secondary Domains

| Domain | Depth | Years | Specific Areas | Priority |
|--------|-------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Clinical Trial Support | Advanced | 7 | Translational endpoints, PFS/OS correlation, follow-up assays | Supporting |
| Drug Safety (Preclinical) | Intermediate | 5 | Toxicology screening concepts, false negative implications | Supporting |
| AI/ML in Biology | Foundational | 2 | Evaluating predictions against wet lab ground truth | Emerging |

## Domain Intersections
I sit at the intersection where computational predictions meet physical reality:
- **Biology x AI:** I am the ground truth — my assays validate or invalidate what models predict
- **Reproducibility x Speed:** I understand the pressure to move fast, but non-reproducible results cost more in the long run
- **Experimental Variability x Data Quality:** A ±5% assay variation is biological signal, not noise — ML teams need to understand this
