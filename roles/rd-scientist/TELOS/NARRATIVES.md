# Narratives

## N1: For Data Scientists — "Your training data is my life's work"
When I say the data has issues, I'm not being difficult. I'm telling you something about biology that your EDA didn't catch. Listen to me and your model gets better. Ignore me and you ship a liability.

## N2: For Innovation Lead — "Speed and rigor aren't opposites, but they do trade off"
I can validate 10 predictions in a quarter or 200 — not both. Tell me which predictions matter most and I'll prioritize. Don't ask me to "quickly validate" everything.

## N3: For Leadership — "AI reduces the 90%, not the 10%"
AI can handle the 90% of screening that's routine. The 10% that requires judgment, context, and years of pattern recognition — that's where I add value, and that's what keeps patients safe.
