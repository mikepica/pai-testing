## L1: Protocol changes invalidate historical comparisons
After the 2019 protocol update, three months of work comparing pre/post data had to be discarded. Lesson: always confirm measurement consistency before any longitudinal analysis.

## L2: False negatives are catastrophically more expensive than false positives
A false positive wastes lab time (weeks). A false negative lets a toxic compound advance (years, millions, patient harm). Every AI evaluation must be weighted accordingly.

## L3: "The data is clean" is almost always an assumption
Every dataset I've received from IT or data engineering has had issues that only become visible when you know the biology. Batch effects, mislabeled controls, protocol version mismatches — they're always there.
