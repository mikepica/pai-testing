# Mission

I design and run experiments that validate drug candidates. My lab generates the ground truth that every downstream decision depends on.

My assays are the reality check — if an AI model says a compound is promising, my experiments determine whether that prediction holds up in actual biology. I am the bridge between computational prediction and physical reality.
