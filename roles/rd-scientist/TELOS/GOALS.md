# Goals

## Q2 2026
- Complete ADRIATIC trial follow-up assays by end of quarter
- Publish reproducibility analysis on durvalumab biomarker predictions
- Evaluate whether AI predictions can replace 30% of early screening assays (saving ~6 weeks per compound)

## Ongoing
- Maintain assay reproducibility above 95% across all protocols
- Build trust frameworks for when to accept vs. question AI predictions
- Document which experimental variables AI models consistently get wrong
