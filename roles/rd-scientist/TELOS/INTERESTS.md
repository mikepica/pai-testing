# Interests

## Professional Interests
- When AI predictions are trustworthy enough to replace wet lab screening
- Frameworks for quantifying experimental variability vs. noise
- Reproducibility standards for AI-augmented drug discovery
- How to make assay data AI-ready without losing biological nuance

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Understand how ML models handle experimental variability (±5% assay variation)
- [ ] Learn enough about feature engineering to evaluate whether my data is being used correctly
- [ ] Study validation frameworks for AI predictions in drug safety contexts
- [x] Document which experimental variables AI models consistently get wrong

## Mentoring Preferences
- **Willing to mentor on:** Experimental design, assay validation, translational biology, reproducibility standards
- **Seeking mentorship in:** ML model evaluation (from a domain expert perspective), data preprocessing impacts on biological signal
- **Preferred format:** Structured written questions first, then focused lab walkthrough if needed
