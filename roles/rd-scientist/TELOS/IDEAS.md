## I1: AI-Assisted Anomaly Flagging for Assays
Instead of using AI for predictions, use it for anomaly detection — flag assay results that deviate from expected patterns. I'd trust this faster because it augments my judgment rather than replacing it.

## I2: Cross-Lab Reproducibility Dashboard
Automated comparison of assay results across our 12 labs. If lab A and lab B get different results on the same compound, surface it immediately rather than discovering it at publication.

## I3: Structured Validation Protocol Templates
Pre-built validation frameworks for common AI prediction types. Saves me from designing a validation plan from scratch every time a data scientist wants me to test something.
