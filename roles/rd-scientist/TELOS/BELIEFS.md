# Beliefs

- Biology is messy and any AI that pretends otherwise is dangerous
- Reproducibility is non-negotiable — if I can't reproduce it, it doesn't count
- The best AI augments my judgment, it doesn't replace it
- Experimental variability is information, not error
- A false negative in drug safety has infinitely higher cost than a false positive
