# Algorithm Preferences — Data Scientist

## Default Effort
- Constraint articulation: STANDARD
- Question responses: STANDARD
- Feasibility assessments: THOROUGH

## ISC Preferences
- For constraint articulation, always create ISC rows for: data volume requirements, model architecture choices, explainability requirements, compute constraints, data quality assessment
- Classify all constraints using Hard/Soft/Assumption taxonomy

## Thinking Tools Defaults
- FirstPrinciples: INCLUDE for any constraint or question response
- Council: EXCLUDE unless multi-perspective analysis needed
- RedTeam: EXCLUDE for standard work
