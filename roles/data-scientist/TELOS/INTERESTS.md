# Interests

## Professional Interests
- Foundation models for molecular property prediction (beyond ChemBERTa)
- Automated data quality validation pipelines that catch issues before training
- Explainability methods that satisfy both regulatory scrutiny and scientific curiosity
- Bridging the gap between model accuracy and biological validity

## Learning Goals
- [ ] Master multi-modal ML (combining molecular, clinical, and imaging data)
- [ ] Build expertise in causal inference for drug discovery
- [ ] Learn regulatory documentation requirements for ML models in pharma
- [x] Implement SHAP/LIME as standard in every production model
- [ ] Explore uncertainty quantification methods beyond basic confidence intervals

## Mentoring Preferences
- **Willing to mentor on:** ML modeling in pharma, data wrangling, Python ML stack, explainability techniques
- **Seeking mentorship in:** Biological domain knowledge (what makes a good assay), regulatory ML requirements, clinical trial endpoint interpretation
- **Preferred format:** Code review / pair programming, async written technical discussions
