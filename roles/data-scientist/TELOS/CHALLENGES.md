# Challenges

- Lab data is messy, inconsistent, and rarely labeled — I spend 70% of my time on data wrangling, not modeling
- Leadership demands explainability but funds black-box approaches — I can't build interpretable models on a GPU budget designed for random forests
- Compute budget is 40% of what I need for proper hyperparameter search and model validation
- R&D scientists want predictions but won't validate my training data — they say "the data is fine" but I see inconsistencies they don't explain
- Drug modalities are shifting (small molecule → ADCs → gene therapy) — historical data may not transfer to new modalities
- Protocol PDFs from clinical trials vary wildly in structure — extracting structured features from unstructured protocols is an unsolved problem in our pipeline
