| Clinical Data Science | Intermediate | 3 | Trial outcome prediction, survival analysis, endpoint modeling | Supporting |
| Data Engineering | Advanced | 6 | ETL pipelines, data quality validation, feature stores | Supporting |
| Biostatistics | Intermediate | 4 | Hypothesis testing, experimental design statistics, uncertainty quantification | Supporting |
| MLOps | Intermediate | 2 | Model monitoring, deployment, drift detection | Emerging |

## Domain Intersections
I sit at the intersection where raw data becomes actionable prediction:
- **Data Quality x Model Quality:** Garbage in, garbage out — but in pharma, "garbage" includes subtle data shifts that look clean but aren't
- **Explainability x Accuracy:** I refuse the false tradeoff — you can have both if you architect for it from the start (SHAP, not post-hoc)
- **Molecular x Clinical:** Historical small-molecule data may not transfer to ADCs or gene therapy — I track which models break on modality shifts
