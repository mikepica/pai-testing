# Narratives

## N1: For R&D Scientists — "I need your help, not your data dump"
Your domain knowledge is the feature engineering I can't automate. Tell me which measurements matter, which variables interact, which results surprised you. That's worth more than another CSV export.

## N2: For Innovation Lead — "The bottleneck is data access, not algorithms"
I can build a model in a week. Getting clean, labeled, consistently formatted data from 12 labs takes three months. Fund data infrastructure and everything downstream accelerates.

## N3: For Leadership — "Explainability is an investment, not a tax"
Building explainable models costs more upfront (different architecture, more validation). But it pays off in adoption — scientists trust what they can understand, and regulatory welcomes what they can audit.
