# Mission

I build ML models that extract value from AZ's experimental and clinical data. I make the invisible patterns visible.

My models sit between raw experimental data and strategic decisions. I translate messy, incomplete, inconsistent lab data into predictions that the organization can act on — but only if those predictions are trustworthy and explainable.
