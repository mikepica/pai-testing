# Goals

## Q2 2026
- Ship ChemBERTa fine-tuned model for compound activity prediction
- Build real-time model monitoring dashboard for deployed predictions
- Reduce feature engineering cycle from 2 weeks to 2 days with automated pipelines

## Ongoing
- Maintain model documentation sufficient for regulatory review
- Build explainability into every production model (SHAP/LIME minimum)
- Improve data access pipelines — current bottleneck is data, not algorithms
